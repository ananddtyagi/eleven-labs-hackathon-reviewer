<h1>About Caring AI</h1>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>In Japan, almost 68,000 people died alone (Kodokushi) last year. This phenomenon is not limited to the elderlyâ€”it affects young people as well. Caring AI aims to address this issue by providing companionship and support, ensuring that no one is truly alone.  </p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Caring AI provides children and social workers with a tool to track whether elders or individuals in need of attention are doing okay. It offers check-ins, task reminders, and meaningful conversations to improve well-being and reduce isolation.  </p>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>I used Lovable, Twilio, and ElevenLabs Conversation AI to build the entire system, step by step, guided by Lovable. The platform integrates real-time voice interaction, AI-driven conversations, and scheduling calls to provide a seamless and caring experience.  </p>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<ul>
<li>WebSocket connection by edge function is hard to debug.<br/></li>
<li>Handling multiple scheduled calls and managing their status.<br/></li>
<li>Managing call length and reflecting its status on the call dashboard.<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<ul>
<li>Created an AI that provides a sense of companionship to users.<br/></li>
<li>Resolved a real-life problem that can reduce costs for people and save lives.<br/></li>
<li>Built an Agentic AI that provides value to both users and buyers.<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>A product is not about the technology it uses, but the problem it solves.<br/></li>
<li>Small adjustments to prompts using dynamic variables can significantly impact the user experience.<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next for Caring AI</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support interval calls (Paid feature).<br/></li>
<li>Transcript for call.<br/></li>
<li>Payment / Subscription system.<br/></li>
<li>Train your own voice / Create your own agent.<br/></li>
<li>Support chat history for better deeper memory system for personalized long-term interactions.<br/></li>
</ul>
