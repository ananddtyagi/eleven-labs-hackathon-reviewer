<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>We love playing video games, but even the most opened world games have finite amounts of combination of interactions, stories, or characters, which are time consuming and costly to develop. 
We feel there are untapped opportunities in the video game industry to have a truly immersive and interactive experience for players. 
What if you could interact and negotiate with every character in a game, or command a group of NPCs or even generate totally unique assets, using your voice and GenAI?</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Vox Populi is a 3D game, with fully generated AI agents with a focus on conversation. You play a king and all other characters are your subjects. It focuses on three elements:
<strong>Single Interaction:</strong> having conversations or commanding an action (such as attacking each other) using your voice
<strong>Group Interaction (AOE):</strong> commanding a group of NPCs to perform an action. 
<strong>Unique Asset Generation:</strong> Negotiating with the blacksmith to create unique armour or weapons through iterative discussion. </p>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>We built out own game engine using NextJS and ThreeJS to handle custom AI entities, voice inputs, world interactions. Developed using Claude and Cursor.</p>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<p>Complex inter-agent interactions, feature creep, developing a game engine from scratch in JS.</p>
<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<p>We did it ! And got some wonderful core functionality developed.</p>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<p>So much - Mostly to do with designing a reasonable game engine.</p>
<h2>What's next for Vox Populi</h2>
<p>We shall see - Lots of interest from other to either play it or open source the code. We shall see ;)</p>
