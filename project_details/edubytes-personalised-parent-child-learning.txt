<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>As a parent, I often feel the urge to complement my child's school education with specific life skills and inspiring topics that ignite their curiosity, such as money management or the wonders of space travel. I recognize that modern education systems can sometimes fall short in addressing individual learning needs, leaving gaps in knowledge and engagement. This realization inspired me to create EduBytes, an AI-driven platform designed to empower parents like me to actively participate in our children's educational journeys. With EduBytes, I can co-create dynamic and personalized learning experiences that align with my child's interests, making education not just a classroom activity but a collaborative adventure at home. </p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>EduBytes empowers parents to create personalized learning experiences for their children. By utilizing a Multimodal Content Generation Engine, EduBytes generates tailored educational materials, including engaging video clips , informative illustrations, age-appropriate audio and simple text. <em>All under 3 minutes!</em> </p>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>The tech stack is based on Python , Gradio for UI, Mistral as LLM for textual content , Fal.ai for images and short video clips and , of course, eleven labs for audio
Took some useful feedback from kids , had a simple Trello baord to be disciplined and better organised </p>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<p>Initial iterations were not on spot. Required lot of improvements to prompting , trialled out different video and image models available via fal.ai. Selecting correct voices on elevenlabs is an ongoing refinement activity. </p>
