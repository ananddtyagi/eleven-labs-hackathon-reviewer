<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Accessing analytics on the go is hardâ€”especially for non-technical users. I wanted a seamless way to interact with data without dashboards, queries, or setupâ€”just by talking. AskCanal was born to make insights as easy as a conversation.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>AskCanal lets users speak to their analytics and get instant insights in natural speech. No more manual queries, dashboards, or complex setupsâ€”just ask.</p>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>Frontend: SwiftUI for a clean iOS experience.
Voice Input: Appleâ€™s native Speech Recognition.
Backend: MCP server to process prompts and return data.
Voice Output: ElevenLabs API via REST for natural speech responses.</p>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<ul>
<li>Achieving fast text-to-voice response.</li>
<li>Originally aimed to build a developer-on-the-go tool (GoWriter) but ran into authentication, UX, and server-client complexitiesâ€”pivoted to AskCanal on Sunday, 23rd.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bridging voice and analytics seamlessly.</li>
<li>Simplifying complex data access for anyone, anywhere.</li>
<li>A clean, intuitive interface.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Handling real-time speech transformations (input &amp; output).</li>
<li>Connecting iOS apps with MCP server responses.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next for AskCanal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implementing key metrics &amp; insights.</li>
<li>Developing first-pass analysis for instant understanding.</li>
<li>Improving user interface &amp; experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>AskCanal is just getting started. ðŸš€</p>
