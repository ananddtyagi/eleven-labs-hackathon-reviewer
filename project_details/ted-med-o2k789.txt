<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Hospitals can be overwhelming and even terrifying for children-- and for 93% of children it is. The sterile environment, unfamiliar faces, and intimidating medical procedures often make kids too scared, shy, or nervous to express what theyâ€™re feeling. This lack of communication leads to missed symptoms, delayed diagnoses, and inaccurate health recordsâ€”problems that can directly impact a childâ€™s health and well-being.</p>
<p>I saw the severity of this issue firsthand through my brother, who worked as a patient care assistant for five years at the best childrenâ€™s hospital in the U.S. When I spoke with him on friday, he told me that one of the biggest challenges he faced daily was getting children to communicate their symptoms. Kids, especially those who were sick, scared, or in pain, often couldnâ€™t or wouldnâ€™t talk about what was wrong.</p>
<p>In response, his hospital had a dedicated system in place where patient care assistants, like my brother, would spend days at a time getting to know patients, building trust, and slowly extracting the critical health information needed for doctors to make informed decisions. But hereâ€™s the problem:</p>
<p>ðŸš¨ Most hospitals do not have the resources to do this.
ðŸš¨ Doctors donâ€™t have the time to spend hours earning a childâ€™s trust.
ðŸš¨ Missed or delayed diagnoses caused by communication gaps can be life-altering.
All children deserve a friend as approachable as my brother to communicate their medical needs. Ted Med is that solution. By combining AI, robotics, and best practices from literature, Ted helps kids open up about their symptoms in a way that feels natural, safe, and even funâ€”allowing doctors to focus on treatment rather than struggling to get answers.</p>
<p>This isnâ€™t just about making hospitals less scary. Itâ€™s about solving a real and urgent problem that affects millions of children every year.</p>
<h2>What It Does</h2>
<p>Ted Med is a breakthrough AI-powered interactive teddy bear that redefines pediatric healthcare by transforming the way children communicate their health concerns. Designed to reduce anxiety, build trust, and enhance medical accuracy, Ted is more than just a companionâ€”itâ€™s a clinically intelligent assistant that helps doctors get the information they need from their youngest patients.</p>
<p>ðŸ§¸ Ted Comforts &amp; Engages Children in Natural Conversation</p>
<ul>
<li>Many children struggle to articulate symptoms due to shyness, fear, or developmental challenges. Ted bridges this gap by using emotionally aware dialogue and child-friendly interactions to encourage kids to open up about their feelings and health concerns.</li>
<li>With speech recognition and animated responses, Ted feels like a real friend, reducing stress and creating a safe space for kids to communicate.
Uses the CARE response method as outlined in Ruocco et al. 2019 to ensure kids feel supported and validated in their medical needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>ðŸ“‹ Ted Gathers Crucial Medical Information</p>
<p>When prompted by hospital staff, Ted doesnâ€™t just chat randomly. He asks targeted, adaptive questions based on the needs of the medical staff to collect the life-saving qualitative data that can be nearly impossible to collect through traditional interviews and practices for some children.</p>
<p>ðŸŽ­ Ted Reads Emotions &amp; Adjusts Its Approach</p>
<p>Leverages facial emotion detection (OpenCV, Mediapipe, DeepFace) enables Ted to sense emotions and adapt his responses accordingly.</p>
<p>ðŸ“ž Ted Calls Caregivers for Follow-Ups</p>
<p>For post-op check-in or if a child doesnâ€™t fully articulate symptoms during the visit, Ted can call parents or caregivers later using Retell AI, ensuring that important medical insights arenâ€™t lost after the appointment ends.
Caregivers can provide additional details through voice or text, making pediatric consultations more comprehensive.</p>
<p>ðŸ›¡ Ted Is the Safest AI for Kids â€“ Rigorously Tested &amp; Medically Verified</p>
<p>Unlike general-purpose chatbots, Ted is engineered from the ground up for safety and accuracy.
Harmful content detection: A fine-tuned RoBERTa discriminator model filters inappropriate or unsafe responses in real-time.
Factual integrity: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on medical response corpora ensures that Ted follows medical best practice.
Benchmarked for safety: Ted was tested on MedSafetyBench &amp; Aegis-AI-Content-Safety and decreased risk index by 60% on average. We also decreased Critical and High Risk Safety events to zero (n=900), only model to do so.</p>
<p>ðŸš¨ Ted Alerts Medical Staff If Something Is Wrong</p>
<p>If a child says anything concerning (e.g., signs of abuse, self-harm, or alarming symptoms), Ted immediately flags the response for medical staff while handling the conversation with sensitivity.
Ted ensures urgent health issues are escalated in real-time, preventing life-threatening conditions from being overlooked.</p>
