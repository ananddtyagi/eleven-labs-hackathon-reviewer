<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<ul>
<li>When cooking, your hand is wet, you are surrounded by ingredients and equipments, you are using gloves, so on and so on.</li>
<li>It is so annoying to keep going back to your phone to look at the recipe to find what to do next, how much water to use, what if I put too much sugar.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hands-free, voice-controlled recipe navigation.</li>
<li>Read and understand recipes from text and URL then adjust serving/ingredients to your liking.</li>
<li>Intelligent task parallelization to save time when cooking: automatically analyze recipe to create an optimized cooking order (e.g. while water is boiling, go chop vegetables).</li>
<li>Answer any question related to instruction such as "What is al dente?", "I added too much salt now what?", "How should my food look like?", "How do I know if the meat is cooked?"</li>
<li>Real-time cooking guidance: guide user through the cooking process step by step, keep track of the conversation to know what the users need help with and provide appropriate suggestions.</li>
</ul>
