<p>We're both dads that love their kids and really need some sleep (so hackathon sounds like a great idea, doesn't it? ;)) We've been dreaming of AI that answers all crazy kids' questions. So they can better discover and understand the world.</p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Endless "why"s.
Desperate silence.
Google fatigue.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>AI answers kids.
Explains stuff.
Dad jokes (maybe).</p>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>AI + kid data.
Voice.
Caffeine IV.</p>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<p>Kids
APIs
Staying awake</p>
<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<p>Kids like it.
It works.
We're alive.</p>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<p>Kids are weird.
AI is cool.
Sleep is a myth.</p>
<h2>What's next for Parent AI</h2>
<p>More answers.
More features.
More coffee.</p>
