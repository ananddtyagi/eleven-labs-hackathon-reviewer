<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>KKStudio was inspired by the need to modernize the beauty salon booking experience. Traditional salon websites often lack the sophistication and user-friendly interfaces that modern clients expect. The project aims to bridge this gap by combining professional beauty services with cutting-edge web technology.  </p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provides an elegant, responsive interface for browsing salon services<br/></li>
<li>Offers a sophisticated booking system for nail and lash appointments<br/></li>
<li>Showcases the salon's work through a dynamic gallery<br/></li>
<li>Features real-time availability checking and appointment scheduling<br/></li>
<li>Implements smooth animations and transitions for an enhanced user experience<br/></li>
<li>Provides a mobile-first design that works seamlessly across all devices<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>How I built it</h2>
<p>The application was built using a modern tech stack:  </p>
<ul>
<li>React with TypeScript for robust frontend development<br/></li>
<li>Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds<br/></li>
<li>shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible UI elements<br/></li>
<li>Tailwind CSS for responsive styling and design<br/></li>
<li>Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions<br/></li>
<li>React Query for efficient data fetching and state management<br/></li>
<li>React Router for seamless navigation<br/></li>
<li>Jest for comprehensive testing<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implementing responsive design across all screen sizes while maintaining the elegant aesthetic<br/></li>
<li>Balancing performance with rich animations and transitions<br/></li>
<li>Creating an intuitive booking flow that works for both desktop and mobile users<br/></li>
<li>Managing complex state across the application while maintaining code quality<br/></li>
<li>Ensuring accessibility standards are met while using custom UI components<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>
<ul>
<li>Created a beautiful, responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices<br/></li>
<li>Implemented a sophisticated component architecture using shadcn/ui<br/></li>
<li>Achieved smooth page transitions and animations using Framer Motion<br/></li>
<li>Built a robust booking system with real-time availability checking<br/></li>
<li>Maintained high code quality with TypeScript and comprehensive testing<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Advanced techniques in React and TypeScript<br/></li>
<li>Best practices for component composition with shadcn/ui<br/></li>
<li>Animation implementation with Framer Motion<br/></li>
