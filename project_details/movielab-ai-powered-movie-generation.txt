<h1>🎬 MovieLab – AI-Powered Movie Generation</h1>
<h2>🚀 Inspiration</h2>
<p>We were inspired by the idea of making <strong>filmmaking accessible to everyone</strong>—from storytellers to filmmakers and AI enthusiasts. Traditional movie-making requires <strong>time, resources, and expertise</strong>, but what if AI could do it <strong>effortlessly</strong>?  </p>
<p>With advancements in <strong>AI-generated media</strong>, we saw an opportunity to merge <strong>scriptwriting, voice synthesis, video generation, and lip-syncing</strong> into a single seamless experience. <strong>MovieLab</strong> brings <strong>your ideas to life</strong>—just from a simple text prompt!  </p>

<h2>🔨 How We Built It</h2>
<p>MovieLab integrates <strong>multiple AI models</strong> into a streamlined pipeline:  </p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>OpenAI Image Analysis</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Extracts <strong>scene details, gender, and age</strong> from the input image to match voices accordingly.<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>2️⃣ <strong>Text Processing &amp; Voice Generation</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Uses <strong>Eleven Labs' TTS</strong> to generate realistic voices.<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>3️⃣ <strong>AI Video &amp; Lip Syncing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>fal-ai/kling-video/v1.6/pro/image-to-video</strong> creates realistic AI-generated scenes.<br/></li>
<li><strong>fal-ai/latentsync</strong> ensures perfect <strong>lip-syncing</strong> between the generated voice and video.<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>4️⃣ <strong>Scene Merging with FFmpeg (Python Backend)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>20-second videos</strong>, we generate <strong>up to 4 scenes</strong> separately.<br/></li>
<li>The last frame of each generated scene is used as the <strong>starting frame</strong> for the next scene.<br/></li>
<li>A <strong>separate Python backend</strong> processes and merges the scenes using <strong>FFmpeg</strong>, ensuring <strong>smooth transitions and continuity</strong>.<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>5️⃣ <strong>Next.js Backend &amp; Frontend</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>main application is built on Next.js</strong>, handling API calls and the UI, while the <strong>Python backend with FFmpeg</strong> is responsible for merging final video sequences.<br/></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>🏆 Challenges We Faced</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lip-sync Accuracy</strong> – Ensuring seamless synchronization between AI-generated video and TTS was tricky.<br/></li>
<li><strong>Video Generation Speed</strong> – Balancing <strong>quality vs. processing time</strong> was a major hurdle.<br/></li>
<li><strong>Scene Continuity &amp; Merging</strong> – Stitching together <strong>multiple AI-generated clips</strong> while maintaining <strong>smooth transitions</strong> required <strong>optimized FFmpeg processing</strong>.<br/></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>📚 What We Learned</h2>
<p>✅ How to <strong>integrate multiple AI models</strong> into a single pipeline for seamless content generation.<br/>
✅ How to use <strong>OpenAI for vision-based voice matching</strong> to enhance realism.<br/>
✅ The importance of <strong>FFmpeg in AI-generated video processing</strong>—optimizing merging and transitions.<br/>
✅ The challenge of balancing <strong>speed, quality, and cost</strong> when working with AI-generated media.  </p>
