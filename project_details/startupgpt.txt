<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>While following YC startups and Hacker News, Mani and I noticed companies like Crustdata (live company data APIs) and Juicebox (AI-powered talent sourcing) gaining traction, with Crustdata’s founder being a friend’s husband. Seeing them raise funding and attract 200+ customers, we wondered: How hard would it be to replicate their core functionality but with a novel focus—"AI-powered startup scouting for investors?"</p>
<p>With <strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong> as a hackathon sponsor and accelerator partner, we recognized that while a16z-backed startups unlock countless opportunities, investors still struggle to efficiently scout, assess, and connect with them. To solve this, we built StartupGPT in less than 8 hours, creating an AI-driven and Agentic  voice-activated scouting platform where AI agents handle everything from NLP-powered search and ranking to real-time insights and automated outreach.
<strong>Features</strong>
