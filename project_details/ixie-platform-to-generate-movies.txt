<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Ever had that moment when you're in the mood for a specific type of movie but end up spending 40 minutes scrolling through Netflix? That was me, every Friday night. I noticed how my friends and I would always start with "I want something like..." before diving into endless streaming catalogs. That's when it hit me - why not flip the script and start with the genre first?</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Ixie is your movie matchmaker with a twist. Pick a genre, and it creates a curated selection of films that match that specific vibe. But here's the cool part - it's not just throwing random movies at you. Using Mistral and ElevenLabs, it creates these mini-narrative threads connecting the films, making the whole discovery process feel like its own little adventure.</p>
<h2>How I built it</h2>
<p>I went all-in with Next.js and TypeScript for the foundation - wanted to keep things fast and type-safe. The UI is all Tailwind. Clerk handles the auth stuff (thankful to them since I could integrate authentication in a matter of minutes), while fal.ai helps with generating the image and videos. The real magic happens with Mistral, ElevenLabs and fal.ai work together to create those narrative connections between movies.</p>
<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>
<p>Getting Mistral, ElevenLabs, and fal.ai to work together was like solving a complex puzzle - lots of moving parts that needed to click just right. I eventually worked it out, but rate limits and concurrent request restrictions were a real pain point (though this wouldn't be an issue in production with proper API access). The biggest challenge was actually designing the user interface - I spent countless hours iterating to find that sweet spot between simplicity and functionality. Making something valuable yet straightforward is surprisingly complex!</p>
<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>
<p>The clean, intuitive user interface is definitely my biggest win - it's amazing how much work goes into making something look effortless. I'm also thrilled to finally work with ElevenLabs, something I've been eager to do for about two-three years now. Working with cutting-edge tech has really opened my eyes to the potential here - with more advanced models coming in the next few months and proper investment, this could genuinely be the next Netflix. I'm also proud of stepping out of my comfort zone with new technologies - discovering how seamless Clerk makes authentication was a pleasant surprise!</p>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>This project was a crash course in many areas. I dove deep into UI/UX research to deliver a better user experience. Learning to orchestrate multiple AI agents together was fascinating, and getting hands-on with the ElevenLabs API (after only using their studio before) was a great learning experience. I'm excited to apply these skills to future personal projects.</p>
<h2>What's next for Ixie: Platform to generate movies</h2>
<p>The next big step is implementing tiered pricing - different subscription levels will unlock access to higher-quality movie generations using more sophisticated models. While length isn't a constraint, the quality of generated content directly correlates with the models used, and better models mean higher costs. One thing I'm particularly eager for is ElevenLabs' director mode - their current emotion control is quite challenging, and this feature would be a game-changer for creating more engaging content.</p>
