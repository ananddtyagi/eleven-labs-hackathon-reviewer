<h1>CapAgent: Revolutionizing Sales Training with AI</h1>
<h2>🚀 Inspiration</h2>
<p>Consultative sales require highly skilled professionals who master both sales strategies and in-depth product knowledge. However, with a 20% turnover rate in sales teams, companies constantly struggle to train new employees without sacrificing the productivity of their best executives.</p>
<p>We asked ourselves: How can we speed up this process without compromising sales? How can we empower new talent and help them become sales experts faster?</p>
<p>That's how <strong>CapAgent</strong> was born—a tool designed to enhance the skills of aspiring salespeople, supporting both young professionals entering their first jobs and experienced individuals who struggle to adapt to new technologies. Our mission is to bridge the knowledge gap and provide a smarter, faster, and more efficient way to train sales teams.</p>
