<p>About the Project</p>
<p>This project is a comprehensive healthcare assistant app designed specifically for doctors. It integrates cutting‐edge AI from OpenAI with Firebase for real-time data and PostHog for detailed user analytics to support clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>Inspiration &amp; Objectives</p>
<p>Doctors often face overwhelming data and time pressure when diagnosing and treating patients. This project was inspired by the need for a tool that not only provides predictive insights—such as risk assessments, differential diagnoses, and treatment recommendations—but also monitors user interactions to continuously improve the app’s usability. By integrating PostHog, we capture rich analytics on how doctors interact with the app, allowing us to optimize features and ensure the tool meets clinical needs.</p>
<p>What I Learned</p>
<p>AI Clinical Support: Leveraging OpenAI’s API to generate concise, evidence-based clinical recommendations.</p>
<p>Real-Time Data Management: Using Firebase for secure authentication and dynamic data updates.</p>
<p>User Analytics with PostHog: Tracking events and user behavior to refine and personalize the doctor’s experience.</p>
<p>UI/UX Design: Creating a clean, responsive interface with a consistent green-and-white color scheme tailored for busy medical professionals.</p>
<p>How It Works</p>
<p>User Interface: The mobile app, built with Flutter, includes screens for login, patient management, chat, and various clinical tools.</p>
<p>Clinical Tools: Doctors can assess patient risk, summarize clinical notes, generate differential diagnoses, check medication interactions, and get treatment recommendations—all powered by AI.</p>
<p>Analytics &amp; Feedback: PostHog is integrated to capture events such as screen views, button taps, note edits, and consultation milestones. This data drives improvements and ensures the app stays aligned with the real needs of clinicians.</p>
