<h1>Shopperly.ai - The Story</h1>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>What Inspired Us
It started with a laugh—Harry bragging about his thrift skills, me countering with my own bargain tales. But then it hit us: why are we busting our butts manually scouring the web when we could make an AI do it? We wanted a sidekick that'd whisper, "Yo, that TV's $50 cheaper over here," or "Talk to me, bro, I'll find you a deal." That's when Shopperly.ai was born—a vision to save wallets worldwide, one witty chat at a time.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Shopperly.ai is your deal-hunting MVP, scouring the web to snag the best prices on anything—Celtics tickets, the hottest kicks, you name it. No more tab-juggling or overpaying—just chat with our slick AI, cooked up by tech wizards Thomas and Harry. "Yo, Shopperly, find me a cheap jersey!"—bam, it's done, faster than Harry can chug a $3 energy drink. Whether you're courtside dreaming or style-stalking, Shopperly's got your back, in 34 languages, all day, every day.</p>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>Harry and Thomas were grinding away on Discord during the final 48 hours of the hackathon. Initially, they planned to go the browser use route, but after their servers kept crashing (and crashing, and crashing again), these wild dudes had an idea—what if they made it a chatty orb instead? So they pivoted hard. Now it's this slick text-based AI that vibes with you through 11 Labs voice tech and Perplexity's smarts, all wrapped up in this 100% Lovable-built react app.
It's a beast—you just chat with the orb, and it hooks you up with deals while keeping the conversation flowing. Harry handled the hype, mocking up designs and plotting how they'd sell it: $100 lifetime access (jumping to $500 soon) or $30 a month. Oh, and they'd rake in cash by selling anonymized search data and letting businesses sponsor their gear. It's like they're deal hunters and masterminds.</p>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<p>Let's talk about our biggest plot twist—Chrome extensions. Man, Harry and Thomas were deep in the hackathon grind, thinking they'd build this slick iframe-based deal hunter. But browser use had other plans. They're on Discord, energy drinks in hand, when reality hits: Chrome's security is tighter than a hipster's jeans, and iframes? Not happening.
But here's where it gets wild. Instead of throwing in the towel, they're messaging each other at 2 AM: "Dude, what if we ditch the browser thing entirely?" Browser use was tanking anyway, so why fight it? They pivoted faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer, scrapped all that browser API nonsense, and went all-in on building this chatty AI orb instead.
The switch to 11 Labs and Perplexity wasn't exactly smooth sailing either—imagine trying to teach a new language while also learning it yourself. But compared to wrestling with browser permissions and watching their servers crash more times than they could count? It was like trading a broken skateboard for a hoverboard.
Sure, they probably aged five years in those final 48 hours of the hackathon. But sometimes the best ideas come from everything going wrong in exactly the right way. Now they've got this deal-hunting AI that actually works, talks back, and doesn't care what browser you're using. Take that, iframe restrictions!</p>
<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<p>Let's talk numbers for a second. Five months ago, Harry and Thomas were just two random dudes who connected in the Lovable Discord. Now? They've launched renamify.co, a SaaS app built entirely with Lovable that's exploded to over 100,000 users in just a few months. Not too shabby for a friendship that started with some Discord messages!
The coolest part? This wasn't just some throwaway hackathon project. These guys turned a Discord connection into a serious tech partnership, building renamify.co into something that hundreds of thousands of people actually use. And now they're back at it again, cooking up their next project—a deal-hunting AI that's about to flip the game on its head.</p>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<p>Talk about a face-palm moment! After spending five weeks throwing ideas at the wall like overcooked spaghetti, Harry and Thomas finally figured out the secret sauce during this hackathon: sometimes you just gotta stop overthinking and start building. It's like they suddenly remembered the old saying "done is better than perfect," except they learned it the hard way.
There they were, knee-deep in browser API docs and iframe dreams, when reality kicked down the door. Chrome extensions? Nope. Server stability? About as reliable as a chocolate teapot. But here's the real gold: instead of spending another five weeks debating the perfect tech stack, they just... pivoted. Ditched the browser headaches, embraced the AI orb life with 11 Labs and Perplexity, and actually built something that works.
The biggest lesson? You can spend forever planning the perfect route, or you can start walking and adjust your GPS along the way. After watching renamify.co blow up to 100,000 users, you'd think they'd have learned this already. But sometimes you need a 48-hour hackathon crunch to remind you that the best ideas don't come from overthinking—they come from doing. And hey, if two guys who met on Discord can figure this out, anyone can!</p>
<h2>What's next for shopperly.ai</h2>
<h3>The Short Version</h3>
<p><strong>Ties to the Business Plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short-Term (6-12 Months): 1,000 users, marketing push, $100 deal momentum, initial sponsorships.</li>
<li>Long-Term (2-5 Years): 50,000 users, advanced data monetization, B2B expansion.</li>
<li>Revenue Goals: $150K Year 1, multi-stream growth (subscriptions, data, sponsorships).
### The Long Version
Alright, let's set the scene: Thomas and Harry, two tech wizards extraordinaire, hunched over glowing screens in a makeshift metaverse lab (Thomas's garage, now tricked out with dual monitors and Harry's $10 air fryer humming like a server fan). Shopperly.ai's just the beginning—we're the geeky masterminds who turned deal-hunting into a science, and we're about to crank it to eleven. What's next? Oh, it's a wild, thrifty ride, and we've got the code (and caffeine) to make it happen!
Thomas, mid-sip of his fifth coffee, taps away at Shopperly.ai's core. "Harry, what if this thing predicts deals before users even blink?" Harry, debugging with one hand and clutching a $3 energy drink with the other, cackles, "And what if we make that search data so juicy, businesses beg us for it?" That's the plan—our twin tech brains are syncing up to scale Shopperly.ai into a global savings machine, and we're having a blast doing it.
Growth's step one. Our business blueprint's got us chasing 1,000 paying users in the first month—moms, gamers, that jock Chad from the Super Bowl ad, all geeking out over our AI. Thomas is coding up a storm, juicing the app with predictive smarts, while Harry's rigging a marketing bot to spam TikTok with "Shopperly Dance" memes (we're tech wizards, not dancers—pray for us). The $100 lifetime deal's still live at <a href="https://preview--product-spark-launcher.lovable.app/home" rel="nofollow">https://preview--product-spark-launcher.lovable.app/home</a>, and we're milking it 'til it hits $500, pulling in deal-hunters like moths to a flame.
Then there's the cash flow. Harry's tweaking the AI to flag sponsorship gold—imagine a popup: "These $20 headphones brought to you by Brand X!" Thomas, meanwhile, is turning our 34-language search data into a treasure chest—anon, of course. "Businesses will pay us to know what Jen in Spain and Mike in Japan are hunting," he says, eyes gleaming. Year one? We're projecting $150,000, with subscriptions, data sales, and sponsorships fueling the fire.
Sure, we've had hiccups—Thomas once caught the AI trying to hawk a $1,000 toaster. "Not on my watch!" Harry zapped it with a debug spell. Now, we're dreaming bigger: 50,000 users in two years, a B2B Shopperly for retailers, maybe even a "Deal Bot" spinoff. We'll hire a few code minions to keep up, but it's our tech wizardry driving this ship. Thomas grins, "We're killing overpaying, one line of code at a time." Harry nods, "And banking millions while we're at it!"
So, what's next? Picture us fist-bumping as Shopperly.ai hits the big leagues—users saving millions, businesses drooling over our data, and our garage glowing with tech glory. Two wizards, one mission: make shopping smarter, cheaper, and way more fun. Who's ready to geek out with us?</li>
