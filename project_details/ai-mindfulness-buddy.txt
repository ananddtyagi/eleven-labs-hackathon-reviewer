<h1><strong>Momentum: Your AI-Powered Mindfulness Buddy</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Why I Built This</strong></h2>
<p>We live in a world that constantly demands our attention—endless notifications, economic uncertainty, and a flood of stressful news. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, stuck, or unmotivated.  </p>
<p>I wanted to build something that could <strong>cut through the noise and provide instant, personalized mental support.</strong> Not just another meditation app, but an <strong>AI agent that understands you, speaks to you, and helps you shift your mindset in real time.</strong> </p>
<p>That’s why I created <strong>Momentum</strong>—your <strong>AI-powered mindfulness agent</strong> that delivers <strong>instant motivation, actionable self-care techniques, and real-time speech support</strong> to help you reset, refocus, and regain control of your mindset.  </p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Challenges I Ran Into</strong></h2>
<p>Building an <strong>AI agent for mindfulness</strong> came with unique challenges:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Making AI Feel Human</strong> – AI-generated responses had to be <strong>warm, conversational, and truly supportive</strong> rather than generic.<br/></li>
