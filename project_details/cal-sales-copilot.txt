<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>The daily challenges faced by sales teams inspired me to create Cal Sales CoPilot. We noticed three key pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual narration of pitch decks consuming valuable time</li>
<li>Lead qualification process being repetitive and time-consuming</li>
<li>No-show meetings disrupting schedules and requiring manual follow-ups</li>
</ul>
<p>You can watch complete demo covering everything :- <a href="https://youtu.be/9o_8Y21MDNI" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/9o_8Y21MDNI</a></p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Cal Sales CoPilot is an AI-powered sales assistant that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically narrates pitch decks using ElevenLabs' text to speech API.</li>
<li>Qualifies leads through phone conversations and books meetings via cal.com
Based on your logic for eg:- your team doesnâ€™t have bandwidth for low ticket clients like small company size. etc. Our AI agent would make an outbound call and book a meeting if the lead meets the condition</li>
<li>Manages no-shows by AI agent automatically calling to remind them about the meeting and rescheduling if they are not available right now.</li>
<li>Generates audio summaries using text-to-speech API and transcripts post-meeting and send to all the attendees or hosts.</li>
<li>Key Innovation: Uses phone numbers instead of emails for booking to avoid speech recognition errors in AI conversations. (<a href="https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/17635" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/17635</a>)</li>
</ul>
