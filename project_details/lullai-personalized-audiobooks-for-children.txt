<h1>LullAI - Personalized Audiobooks for Children</h1>
<h3>ElevenLabs x a16z Hackathon</h3>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Babies and toddlers are highly attuned to their parents' voices, finding comfort, security, and familiarity in their tone and rhythm. However, modern lifestyles often make it difficult for parents to be physically present for every bedtime story or soothing lullaby. Whether due to work commitments, travel, or other responsibilities, moments of shared reading can sometimes be missed in the critical stage of psychological development.  </p>
<p>While many bedtime storybooks come with audio versions on the market, they often feature <strong>generic, robotic voices</strong> that lack the warmth and familiarity of a parent's voice, making it difficult to recreate the genuine storytelling experience only a parent can provide.  </p>
<p><strong>LullAI</strong> addresses this by leveraging <strong>AI-powered voice cloning and text-to-speech techniques</strong>. It aims to bridge that gap—allowing parents to preserve their unique voice and use it to read stories to their children, even when they’re not physically present. Imagine a <strong>deployed parent</strong> still being able to read their child's favorite bedtime story, or a <strong>grandparent’s voice</strong> continuing to nurture a young one long after they’ve passed.  </p>
<p>The project is inspired by the need to <strong>keep that connection alive</strong> in a meaningful and interactive way.  </p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>This web app allows parents to <strong>clone their voice</strong> and use it to <strong>read books aloud</strong> to their newborns, infants, and toddlers. By leveraging AI-driven voice synthesis, the app creates a natural-sounding version of the parent’s voice that can narrate <strong>children’s books, bedtime stories, and lullabies</strong>. Parents can upload books or enter text, ensuring their children always hear a familiar and comforting voice, even when they are not physically present. </p>
<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voice Cloning:</strong> Parents record a short sample, and the app generates an AI-powered synthetic voice. </li>
<li><strong>Text-to-Speech Conversion:</strong> The cloned voice reads aloud stories in a natural, expressive manner. </li>
</ul>
