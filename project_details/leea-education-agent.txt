<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Children are natural learners, but traditional education methods often lack engagement and personalization. Every child has unique interests and learns at their own pace. We are creating an AI-powered learning companion—an autonomous agent that adapts to each child's curiosity, provides dynamic storytelling, and fosters interactive learning. By leveraging AI agents, we designed a system where learning is conversational, immersive, and personalized: a brave astronaut, a talking cat, or a friendly train conductor? Exploring the world have never been that fun.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Leea Education Agent is an autonomous AI learning companion that generates customized educational stories based on a child's:</p>
<ul>
<li>age</li>
<li>interests</li>
<li>activity time whether it’s the afternoon learning rush or evening calming story</li>
<li>previous learning experience with Leea
We are building set of agents:
(1) Personalized animated character generator (with memory of all created characters).
(2) The narrator agent that crafts an engaging, age-appropriate narrative and creates the stories and exercises.
(3) The voiceover service: using the Eleven Labs API
(4) Service for animation of the character with real time lip syncing.
(5) The progress and pace agents for tracking the learning path, tone and suggesting the narrator high level plans and strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>All generated content will be reviewed and refined with child psychologists and pediatricians to ensure educational and emotional safety.</p>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<ul>
<li>LLM-Powered Storytelling – AI-generated narratives dynamically adapt to the selected topic and character.<br/></li>
<li>Eleven Labs API – High-quality, expressive text-to-speech for a natural voice experience.<br/></li>
<li>AI-Driven Animation – Lip-sync technology animates characters in real-time for immersive storytelling.<br/></li>
<li>Human-in-the-loop validation – Ensuring content safety and age-appropriate learning with expert reviews.<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>To create a truly agentic learning experience, we developed a system where multiple AI agents work together:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Storytelling Agent – Generates dynamic, interactive narratives tailored to the child's interests.<br/></li>
<li>Knowledge Agent – Ensures factual accuracy by retrieving relevant, expert-verified educational content.<br/></li>
<li>Emotional Intelligence Agent – Adapts tone, complexity, and pacing based on the child’s responses.<br/></li>
</ol>
<p>These agents collaborate autonomously to create an evolving, interactive learning journey.  </p>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<ul>
<li>Real-time adaptation – Ensuring smooth, natural interactions required fine-tuning AI models for dynamic responsiveness.<br/></li>
<li>Balancing storytelling with factual accuracy – We are integrating a knowledge verification system to keep content both engaging and educational.<br/></li>
<li>Ethical AI design – AI-generated content for children requires strict safety measures, so we worked with child psychologists to refine prompts and interactions.<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developed an interactive AI agent that makes learning adaptive and conversational rather than static.<br/></li>
<li>Successfully implemented multi-agent collaboration for more immersive educational experiences.<br/></li>
<li>Integrated high-quality speech synthesis and animation, real-time lip-sync animation, and intelligent response adaptation to create a seamless learning journey.<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive AI storytelling improves engagement and makes learning more intuitive for young minds.<br/></li>
<li>Multi-agent collaboration creates more reliable, flexible, and dynamic AI interactions.<br/></li>
<li>Collaboration with child psychologists and educators is crucial in developing AI-powered tools for kids.<br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next for Leea Education Agent</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing real-time conversation abilities to allow more natural back-and-forth interactions.<br/></li>
<li>Introducing emotion detection to further adapt lessons based on child engagement.<br/></li>
<li>Expanding to multiple languages and accessibility features for a global reach.<br/></li>
<li>Exploring Web3 integration for collectible, interactive learning experiences.</li>
</ul>
