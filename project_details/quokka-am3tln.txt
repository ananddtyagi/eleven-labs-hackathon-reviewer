<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>The project was born from a common challenge in online education: making video content more interactive and effective for learning. Traditional video platforms lack the tools to help students actively engage with the material and test their understanding in real-time. We saw an opportunity to use AI to transform passive video watching into an active learning experience.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Quokka enhances educational videos with:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI-generated quizzes with automatic timestamps</li>
<li>Interactive chat discussions about video content</li>
<li>Real-time transcription powered by fal.ai's Whisper</li>
<li>Smart video management and organization</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>The platform is built using modern web technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean, responsive UI built with Lovable's component system</li>
<li>fal.ai integration for:

<ul>
<li>Video transcription</li>
<li>Quiz generation</li>
<li>Chat interactions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Real-time video processing with timestamp synchronization</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implementing accurate video timestamp synchronization with quizzes</li>
<li>Creating an intuitive UI that handles multiple AI features without overwhelming users</li>
<li>Ensuring high-quality AI-generated content that truly aids learning</li>
<li>Building a responsive design that works seamlessly across devices</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<ul>
<li>Successfully integrated fal.ai's AI capabilities for real-time video processing</li>
<li>Created a seamless and intuitive learning experience</li>
<li>Built a polished UI using Lovable that handles complex features elegantly</li>
<li>Developed an effective quiz generation system that enhances learning</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Integration of fal.ai's AI services with video content</li>
<li>Building polished interfaces with Lovable</li>
<li>Managing complex state for interactive features</li>
<li>Video processing and playback optimization</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next for Quokka</h2>
<ul>
<li>Advanced analytics to track learning progress</li>
<li>Collaborative learning features for group study</li>
<li>Custom quiz creation tools for educators</li>
