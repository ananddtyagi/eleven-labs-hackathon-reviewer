<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Last week I had a call with the team in my project about new requirements from the business regarding displaying different business data. Again. New version. It is always a compromise between different departments about dashboards, page layouts etc. I said, "There should be AI Agent that prepares dynamic dashboards and then each User will see desired stuff.". One girl replied: "Please do not say it to the business.". I will not say it to them. I will show it to them.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>dashpers allows  to create personalized business dashboards through natural language commands.</p>
<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>Stack: lovable (React, TypeScript, Tailwind), fal.ai, pica, render, IIElevenLabs, supabase, edge functions. Used Anthropic framework of effective ai agent - <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents" rel="nofollow">Building effective agents</a></p>
<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<ul>
<li>I had to run external Node.js server to be able to use Pica SDK, it was not possible to use it via supabase edge functions,</li>
<li>max stack limit calling IIElevenLabs,</li>
<li>lovable changed unnecessary code from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<p>In quite limited time and resources (solo) I was able to provide some features that I am satisfied with. I was struggled at the beginning with some tools that I did not use before (probably I could deliver more with Cursor), but finally I am happy about the results.</p>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<p>This time instead of Cursor I decided to use new tech stack: <strong>lovable, pica, fal.ai</strong> - I did not use it before. It was fun!</p>
<h2>What's next for dashpers</h2>
<p><strong>Publish quick demo for feedback and talk to users.</strong>
Regarding tech improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>better chat with all the contents and sources,</li>
<li>more tools, mostly enterprise ones, for example connection to datalake like databricks,</li>
<li>better grid configuration (e.g. moving widgets with drag and drop),</li>
<li>speech to text - configure the dashboards with voice,</li>
<li>conversation history,</li>
<li>more actions and interactions with components (like links, records editing etc.).</li>
</ul>
