    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Ted-Med's potential to solve a critical healthcare communication problem affecting 93% of children, highlighting its comprehensive technical implementation, innovative approach, and strong safety measures. The critic raises concerns about scalability, technical complexity, privacy issues, and lack of clinical validation, while questioning the real-world practicality and implementation challenges.",
    
    "analysis": "Both sides present valid arguments. The project shows impressive technical sophistication and addresses a genuine healthcare need. However, the critic's concerns about clinical validation, security, and practical implementation are significant. The solution is innovative but may be overengineered, potentially creating new challenges while solving existing ones. The balance between technological advancement and practical healthcare implementation needs careful consideration.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "Ted-Med is an ambitious and well-conceived project that shows significant promise in pediatric healthcare. While the technical implementation and creative approach are impressive, several critical issues need addressing before real-world deployment. Recommendations: 1) Conduct clinical trials and obtain necessary medical certifications, 2) Simplify the technical architecture to reduce potential points of failure, 3) Develop robust privacy and security protocols, 4) Create a clear implementation and maintenance strategy, and 5) Build offline capabilities. The project scores highly overall (8/10) but requires these refinements to reach its full potential. Its innovative approach to a critical healthcare challenge makes it worthy of further development with appropriate medical oversight and validation."
