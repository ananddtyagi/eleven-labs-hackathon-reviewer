    "summary": "The Advocate emphasizes the project's potential for universal impact in personal finance management, solid technical foundation with React and Supabase, innovative combination of voice AI with financial management, and clear future development path. The Critic highlights concerns about lack of differentiation, incomplete technical implementation, security concerns, and insufficient documentation and testing.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project shows promise in making financial management more accessible through AI integration, but has significant gaps in implementation and security. The core concept is valuable, though not revolutionary. The technical foundation is adequate but needs substantial development. The presentation shows clear vision but lacks crucial details. The balance between potential and current limitations suggests a promising project in early stages that requires substantial refinement.",

    "final_verdict": "My-dollar-buddy shows promise but requires significant development to reach its potential. Priority recommendations: 1) Implement robust security measures for financial data handling 2) Complete the structured data integration with the database 3) Develop clear differentiators from existing solutions 4) Add comprehensive documentation and conduct user testing 5) Focus on completing core features before expansion. The project scores above average on potential impact due to the universal need for financial management tools, but current technical implementation and presentation need substantial improvement. The creativity score reflects a good but not groundbreaking concept. With the recommended improvements, this could become a valuable contribution to personal finance management tools."
