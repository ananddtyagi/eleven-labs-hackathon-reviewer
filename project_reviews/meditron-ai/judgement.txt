    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Meditron's potential to revolutionize healthcare accessibility, sophisticated technical integration of multiple AI services, and clear market opportunity. They highlight the innovative multi-stage consultation process and scalable architecture. The critic points out significant concerns about regulatory compliance, medical liability, lack of professional validation, and potential safety risks. They also note the absence of a clear business model and the need for technical refinement.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project demonstrates technical sophistication and addresses a genuine need in healthcare accessibility. However, the critic's concerns about medical liability, regulatory compliance, and safety are crucial in healthcare technology. The implementation shows promise but requires significant development in terms of safety measures, validation, and business planning. The technical architecture is impressive but needs refinement for scalability and reliability.",

    "final_verdict": "Meditron AI demonstrates strong potential with a score of 6.5/10. The project shows impressive technical integration and addresses a significant healthcare need. However, several critical areas need attention before real-world deployment:

1. Develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance strategy
2. Establish partnerships with medical professionals for validation
3. Implement robust safety measures and error handling
4. Create a detailed business plan with clear monetization strategy
5. Refactor code for better scalability and reliability
6. Address data privacy and HIPAA compliance

The project shows promise but requires substantial development in these areas before it can be considered for actual medical applications. Recommend focusing on medical validation and regulatory compliance as immediate next steps."
