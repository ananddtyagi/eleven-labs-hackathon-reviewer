    "summary": "The Advocate emphasizes the project's potential to revolutionize small business pricing operations, its sophisticated technical implementation despite limitations, and its innovative approach to combining voice AI with pricing automation. The Critic highlights security concerns, lack of proper backend infrastructure, potential adoption challenges, and questions the novelty of the solution.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project addresses a genuine problem with an interesting solution, but has significant technical limitations. The combination of voice AI and pricing automation shows innovation, though the core pricing calculator concept isn't new. The implementation shows promise but needs substantial development for production use. The presentation is clear but could benefit from more professional polish and concrete examples.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "The project shows promising potential with a solid core concept addressing a real business need. However, several critical improvements are needed before production deployment: 1) Implement proper backend infrastructure with secure function evaluation, 2) Add robust error handling and validation, 3) Develop more comprehensive security measures, 4) Include concrete examples and use cases in presentation, 5) Add features for complex pricing scenarios. The project earns a composite score of 6.25/10, reflecting both its innovative potential and current limitations. It's recommended to proceed with development while focusing on addressing the security and infrastructure concerns identified."
