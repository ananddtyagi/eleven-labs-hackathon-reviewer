    "summary": "The advocate highlights Greenroom's innovative approach to AI interaction, strong technical implementation, and broad applicability across professional domains. Key strengths include real-time visualization of AI thought processes, flexible user control, and sophisticated integration of multiple technologies. The critic raises concerns about technical complexity, dependency risks, privacy issues, and lack of concrete business strategy, while questioning the project's practical implementation and market viability.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives present valid arguments. The project demonstrates innovative thinking in solving the AI control problem through visual interaction, with impressive technical scope. However, the critic raises legitimate concerns about implementation complexity and real-world viability. The balance lies in recognizing the project's potential while acknowledging the significant technical and practical challenges that need addressing. The lack of concrete demonstrations and business strategy are notable gaps, but the core concept addresses a genuine need in AI interaction.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "Greenroom is an innovative project with strong potential, earning a total weighted score of 7/10. While the core concept is compelling and technically ambitious, several critical areas need attention before it can be viable for real-world deployment. Recommendations: 1) Develop a minimum viable product focusing on core features to reduce complexity, 2) Create a clear business strategy and market positioning, 3) Address security and privacy concerns as top priorities, 4) Implement robust error handling and fallback systems, 5) Conduct user testing to validate the visual interface approach. The project shows promise but requires refinement to balance innovation with practical implementation."
