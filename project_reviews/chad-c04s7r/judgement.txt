    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Chad's potential to democratize smart car technology, highlighting its robust technical architecture, innovative approach to older vehicle integration, and clear vision for development. The critic points out limitations in market differentiation, basic MVP functionality, safety concerns, and gaps in technical implementation details.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project shows promise in addressing accessibility for older vehicles and demonstrates technical competence in integrating various AI services. However, there are legitimate concerns about differentiation from existing solutions and crucial technical challenges that need addressing. The basic MVP functionality contrasts with ambitious future plans, though this is typical for hackathon projects. The presentation is professional but could benefit from more concrete technical details and safety considerations.",
