    "summary": "The Advocate emphasizes Agent SFX's potential to revolutionize game audio production through AI automation, highlighting its dual-platform approach, technical integration, and accessibility benefits. The Critic points out concerns about quality control, third-party dependencies, limited market validation, and potential scalability issues.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates innovative potential in automating game audio production, but also shows significant areas needing improvement. The solution addresses a real problem in game development, but the heavy reliance on third-party APIs and lack of quality control mechanisms are valid concerns. The technical implementation shows promise but lacks depth in critical areas like error handling and performance optimization. While the presentation is clear, it misses important elements like demos and market validation.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "Agent SFX presents an innovative approach to game audio production with strong potential, earning a total weighted score of 7/10. To improve, the team should:
    1. Develop quality control mechanisms and error handling
    2. Reduce dependency on third-party APIs
    3. Conduct market validation and user testing
    4. Expand customization options
    5. Create comprehensive documentation including demos
    The project shows promise but needs refinement to become a robust solution for game developers. The core concept is strong, but implementation and market validation require significant attention."
