    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes hire-labz's potential to solve recruitment inefficiencies through automated screening, highlighting its data-driven approach, customizable features, and dual-sided benefits. The critic points out concerns about limited scope, technical uncertainties, lack of differentiation from existing solutions, and insufficient evidence of effectiveness.",
    
    "analysis": "Both sides present valid arguments. The project addresses a real problem with concrete examples (1000+ applicants, 40% unqualified), and offers a structured solution with practical features. However, the critic raises legitimate concerns about technical depth, security considerations, and differentiation from existing solutions. The truth likely lies in the middle - while the project has merit and potential, it needs more development and validation to prove its effectiveness.",
