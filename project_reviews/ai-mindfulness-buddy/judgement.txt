    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Momentum's potential to address mental wellness through AI-powered personalization, strong technical implementation using modern tools, and clear market opportunity. They highlight the innovative combination of AI text and speech capabilities. The critic points out market saturation, lack of clinical validation, privacy concerns, and argues the solution is derivative with limited technical innovation beyond basic API integrations.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project demonstrates strong technical foundation and addresses a growing need for accessible mental health support. However, the critic's concerns about clinical validation, privacy, and market differentiation are significant. The implementation appears competent but could benefit from more unique features and security measures. While the presentation is professional, it would be strengthened by concrete evidence of effectiveness and user testing.",

    "final_verdict": "Momentum shows promise but requires refinement to achieve its full potential. Recommendations: 1) Partner with mental health professionals for clinical validation, 2) Implement robust privacy measures for sensitive data, 3) Develop unique features beyond basic chat/voice capabilities, 4) Conduct and document user testing, 5) Clear differentiation from existing solutions. While the core concept and technical implementation are solid, addressing these areas would significantly strengthen the project's impact and market position."
