    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's real-world applicability, confirmed user adoption, and potential for transforming e-commerce customer service. They highlight the successful integration with Shopify and thoughtful handling of LLM limitations. The critic points out technical limitations with Dify, lack of concrete metrics, heavy reliance on existing tools, and insufficient detail about security and scalability solutions.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates practical value with a confirmed user, suggesting real-world viability. However, the technical implementation appears limited by platform constraints and lacks crucial details about security and scalability. While the solution addresses a genuine business need, it may not be sufficiently innovative in the increasingly crowded AI customer service space. The presentation effectively communicates the concept but could benefit from more concrete metrics and technical specifications.",
