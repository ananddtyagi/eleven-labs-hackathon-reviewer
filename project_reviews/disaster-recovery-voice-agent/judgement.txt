    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's potential for significant societal impact, strong technical architecture using industry tools, innovative approach to modernizing disaster response, and clear presentation. Key strengths include reduced response times, multilingual support, and FEMA validation. The critic highlights concerns about regulatory compliance, system reliability during disasters, dependence on third-party services, lack of testing evidence, and potential emotional intelligence limitations of AI in crisis situations.",

    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project addresses a critical need with a technically feasible solution, but implementation challenges are significant. The advocate makes compelling arguments about scalability and immediate practical utility, while the critic raises important concerns about real-world deployment challenges and system reliability. The truth likely lies between these views - the project shows strong potential but needs substantial refinement and testing before deployment in critical emergency situations.",

        "impact": 8,

    },

    "final_verdict": "The project earns a strong overall score of 7.5/10. While the concept is compelling and the technical foundation is solid, several key recommendations should be addressed: 1) Develop offline capabilities and system redundancy, 2) Conduct extensive testing with actual disaster survivors, 3) Establish clear protocols for regulatory compliance and data privacy, 4) Create fallback mechanisms for AI limitations in high-stress situations, and 5) Build concrete evidence of system reliability under various disaster scenarios. The project shows excellent promise but requires these refinements before real-world deployment in emergency situations."
