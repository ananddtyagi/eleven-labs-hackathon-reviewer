    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's potential to improve healthcare efficiency, strong technical implementation including AI and database systems, and clear presentation. They highlight the validation by healthcare professionals and practical real-world applications. The critic points out concerns about limited scope, dependency on third-party integrations, security considerations, and lack of detailed technical documentation and market analysis.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project addresses a genuine healthcare problem with a technically sophisticated approach. The implementation of AI agents with medical knowledge and multilingual support is impressive for a hackathon project. However, the critic raises valid concerns about scalability, security, and regulatory compliance that would need addressing for real-world deployment. The short development timeframe and dependency on external systems are legitimate concerns, but not uncommon for hackathon projects. The presentation is professional though lacking some technical details.",

    "final_verdict": "Meridian-Minds shows promising potential with a solid foundation and clear understanding of the healthcare domain. The project earns high marks for presentation and addressing a real need, with good technical implementation given the hackathon constraints. To move forward, the team should: 1) Develop a comprehensive security and compliance strategy, 2) Reduce dependencies on third-party integrations, 3) Conduct user testing and validation, 4) Create a clear monetization strategy, and 5) Provide more detailed technical documentation. Overall, it's a strong hackathon project that could evolve into a valuable healthcare solution with further development."
