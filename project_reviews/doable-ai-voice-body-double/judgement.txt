    "summary": "Advocate emphasizes strong potential societal impact backed by research, impressive technical integration of multiple technologies, innovative combination of body doubling with AI, and clear documentation. Critic highlights concerns about dependency creation, technical integration issues, lack of novelty in core concept, and incomplete feature implementation.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates ambitious goals and thorough research backing, particularly for helping overwhelmed and neurodiverse individuals. The technical implementation shows both promise and challenges - while successfully integrating multiple complex technologies, some core features remain incomplete. The creativity lies more in the combination of existing techniques rather than fundamental innovation. The presentation is detailed but could be more focused. The project balances between impressive scope and practical implementation challenges.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "The project shows strong potential with a score of 7/10 overall. While the impact potential and innovative approach are commendable, technical implementation needs refinement. Recommendations: 1) Focus on completing core features before expansion, 2) Strengthen privacy and security measures, 3) Develop clear metrics for measuring effectiveness, 4) Streamline the technical architecture, 5) Create a more focused pitch. The project addresses a significant need and shows promise, but requires technical consolidation and feature completion before scaling."
