    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Snowball's potential to improve accessibility in software development, its practical implementation with GitHub API integration, and its vision for community-driven evolution. They highlight the project's immediate utility and clear path for growth. The critic points out concerns about limited functionality, heavy API dependence, security considerations, and lack of detailed technical documentation. They also question the project's novelty and market differentiation.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project addresses a genuine need for hands-free coding assistance, particularly for developers with physical limitations. The implementation shows promise with working core functionality, though it's clearly in early stages. The technical foundation exists but lacks depth in crucial areas like security and error handling. While the concept isn't entirely novel, the integration approach and community-driven improvement vision offer interesting possibilities. The presentation effectively communicates the core concept but could benefit from more technical detail and professional polish.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "Snowball demonstrates promising potential with a clear use case and working prototype, earning a moderate overall score. To improve, the team should: 1) Strengthen the technical implementation with security features and error handling, 2) Provide more detailed documentation and technical specifications, 3) Develop a clearer differentiation strategy from existing solutions, and 4) Create a more detailed roadmap for future development. The project's focus on accessibility and community-driven improvement are strong foundational elements to build upon."
