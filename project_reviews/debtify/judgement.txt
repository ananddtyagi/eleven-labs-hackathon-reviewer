    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Debtify's potential to transform debt collection through AI automation, highlighting its market potential, technical integration, and humanizing approach. They praise the clear presentation and scalability. The critic raises serious concerns about ethical implications, regulatory compliance, technical depth, security measures, and the basic nature of the innovation, noting the presentation lacks crucial implementation details.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project addresses a significant market need and shows promise in humanizing debt collection. However, the critic correctly identifies serious gaps in implementation details, compliance considerations, and security measures. The technical implementation appears surface-level, though the core concept is valuable. The presentation is clear but lacks depth in crucial areas. While the innovation of using AI for friendlier debt collection is noteworthy, the execution needs substantial development to be practically viable.",
