    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Doc-Chat's potential for breaking language barriers in document accessibility, highlighting its robust technical implementation combining multiple advanced technologies, and praising the team's clear presentation and problem-solving approach. The critic points out concerns about deployment issues, lack of real-world validation, reliance on common technologies, and questions about the team's technical expertise.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project addresses a significant real-world problem with a well-thought-out solution architecture. The combination of RAG, speech processing, and translation technologies shows technical ambition. However, the deployment issues and lack of unique technological innovation are legitimate concerns. The team's MBA background brings strong product management skills but may limit technical depth. The project demonstrates good potential but needs more validation and technical refinement.",
