    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Pulsato's innovative approach to employee wellbeing monitoring through voice AI, highlighting its technical sophistication, privacy features, and potential for significant workplace impact. They praise the comprehensive presentation and clear implementation timeline. The critic raises concerns about user adoption, data privacy (especially disabled security features), technical maturity given the short development time, and questions whether voice-based surveys actually improve upon existing solutions.",
    
    "analysis": "Both sides present valid arguments. The project shows innovation in applying voice AI to employee surveys, but the critic's concerns about privacy and practical implementation are significant. The technical stack is impressive, but the disabled security features and rushed development time are red flags. While the presentation is comprehensive, there's a lack of validation data and concrete metrics. The potential impact is promising, but adoption challenges could limit real-world effectiveness.",

    "final_verdict": "Pulsato shows significant promise with its innovative approach to employee wellbeing monitoring, earning a solid overall score of 7/10. To improve, the team should:
    1. Prioritize implementing robust security features
    2. Conduct thorough user testing to validate adoption assumptions
    3. Develop clear metrics for measuring success
    4. Create a more detailed privacy protection framework
    5. Consider offering a text-based alternative alongside voice interactions
    
    The project has strong potential but needs refinement in security and practical implementation before being ready for widespread deployment. The innovative use of voice AI and comprehensive presentation demonstrate good fundamentals, but technical security and user adoption concerns need addressing."
