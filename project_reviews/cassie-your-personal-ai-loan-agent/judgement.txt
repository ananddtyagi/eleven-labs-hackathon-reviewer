    "summary": "Advocate emphasizes Cassie's potential to democratize loan guidance through AI, highlighting its user-friendly voice interface, integrated tech stack, and clear roadmap. They praise its societal impact and technical implementation. Critic raises concerns about security, regulatory compliance, scalability limitations, and lack of market validation, noting the reliance on basic infrastructure and third-party services.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project shows promise in making loan guidance more accessible and user-friendly, with a well-thought-out integration of various AI technologies. However, the critic raises valid concerns about financial sector requirements. The absence of security protocols and regulatory compliance details is significant for a financial service. While the tech stack is clever, the reliance on tools like Google Sheets for financial data storage suggests implementation limitations. The project shows innovation in user experience but needs substantial development in backend infrastructure.",
