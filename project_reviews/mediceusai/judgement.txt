    "summary": "Advocate emphasizes MediceusAI's potential to improve patient safety, strong technical foundation, innovative approach to surgical documentation, and validated market interest. Key strengths include real-world validation, comprehensive features, and clear commercialization path. Critic highlights regulatory challenges, technical limitations (especially in speaker diarization and security), possible scalability issues, and concerns about risk management and business model viability. Both sides acknowledge the significant real-world problem being addressed but differ on implementation readiness.",
    
    "analysis": "The project addresses a critical healthcare need with a technically feasible solution. The advocate makes valid points about market validation and potential impact, while the critic raises legitimate concerns about regulatory compliance and technical robustness. The truth likely lies between these positions - the project shows strong promise but needs significant refinement in areas of security, risk management, and technical infrastructure. The team demonstrates good understanding of the problem space but may be underestimating implementation challenges in healthcare settings.",

    "final_verdict": "MediceusAI scores 7/10 overall, showing strong potential but requiring significant development before market readiness. Recommendations: 1) Strengthen security and compliance features, 2) Develop comprehensive risk management protocols, 3) Build partnerships with healthcare IT providers, 4) Expand technical infrastructure for enterprise-level deployment, 5) Create detailed regulatory compliance roadmap. The project demonstrates excellent potential but needs more robust development in critical areas before healthcare deployment. Continue development with focus on security, scalability, and regulatory compliance while maintaining current strengths in user-focused design and real-time processing."
