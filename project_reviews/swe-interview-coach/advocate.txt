Let me provide a structured analysis of the SWE Interview Coach project based on the judging criteria:

Impact (25%)
- Very high potential impact considering the current tech job market and layoffs
- Addresses a real pain point in interview preparation
- Highly scalable as it can help countless job seekers practice interviews
- Democratizes access to interview practice, which is typically limited to those with industry connections
- Clear path for future development and improvements

Technical Implementation (25%)
- Impressive implementation of real-time interaction between voice agent and coding environment
- Well-thought-out tech stack using modern technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn)
- Clever integration of Monaco editor and React Flow for coding and diagramming
- Successfully implemented tool calling to maintain context between user and agent
- Real-time feedback loop demonstrates technical sophistication

Creativity and Innovation (25%)
- Unique approach to interview preparation by combining voice AI with coding environment
- Novel use of ElevenLabs Conversational AI for interactive interview simulation
- Creative solution to the limitation of traditional interview practice methods
- Innovative integration of multiple components (voice, code, diagrams) into one cohesive experience
- Distinguished from existing solutions by providing real-time context-aware feedback

Pitch and Presentation (25%)
- Clear and well-structured project presentation
- Strong problem statement and motivation
- Excellent articulation of technical implementation and challenges
- Transparent about current limitations and future development plans
