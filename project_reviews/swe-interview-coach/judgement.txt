    "summary": "The Advocate emphasizes the project's timely relevance given current tech layoffs, its technical sophistication in combining voice AI with coding environments, and its potential to democratize interview preparation. The Critic points out concerns about market differentiation, technical stability, scalability challenges, and limitations of being a solo project.",
    
    "analysis": "Both sides present valid arguments. The project addresses a genuine need in the market and shows innovative integration of technologies. However, there are legitimate concerns about its technical robustness and long-term sustainability. The implementation demonstrates good initial execution but lacks some crucial features and thorough testing. While the presentation is clear, it could benefit from more concrete evidence of effectiveness and technical details.",

    "final_verdict": "SWE Interview Coach shows strong promise with a score of 7/10 overall. The project effectively addresses a real market need and demonstrates good technical implementation for a solo project. To improve, I recommend:\n1. Develop a clear monetization strategy to ensure sustainability\n2. Add comprehensive testing and error handling\n3. Implement session recording and playback features\n4. Create detailed documentation and usage examples\n5. Consider forming a team to accelerate development and ensure long-term viability\nThe project has potential for significant impact if these improvements are made."
