    "summary": "The Advocate emphasizes dashpers' potential to solve real business pain points in dashboard customization, highlighting its modern tech stack, innovative natural language approach, and clear roadmap. They praise the solo developer's achievement and practical enterprise solution. The Critic points out concerns about market validation, technical limitations, lack of novelty, missing security considerations, and the project's early-stage nature lacking professional polish.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project addresses a genuine business need with modern technology, but also shows signs of being in early development. The technical implementation is ambitious but perhaps overly complex, with some concerning limitations. While the natural language interface isn't entirely novel, the integration approach is creative. The presentation shows clear vision but lacks some professional elements and concrete metrics.",
