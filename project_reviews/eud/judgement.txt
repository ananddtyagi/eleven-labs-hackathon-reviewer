    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's potential for societal impact through accessible mental health support, its modern tech stack, innovative combination of philosophy and AI, and clear future vision. The critic highlights concerns about lack of clinical validation, vague technical details, privacy concerns, and similarity to existing solutions.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project shows promise in addressing mental health accessibility using modern technology, but suffers from implementation gaps and lack of concrete differentiation. While the vision is compelling, the execution needs significant development. The advocate makes strong points about scalability and future potential, while the critic raises legitimate concerns about clinical validation and technical depth. The truth likely lies between these views - the project has merit but requires substantial refinement.",

    "final_verdict": "Eudaimonia shows promise but requires significant development before it can be considered a viable solution. Key recommendations:\n1. Partner with mental health professionals to ensure clinical validity\n2. Develop more detailed technical documentation and architecture\n3. Implement robust security measures for sensitive data\n4. Clearly differentiate from existing solutions\n5. Conduct user testing and provide concrete metrics\n6. Create a detailed implementation plan for the roadmap\n\nThe project scores 5.5/10 overall, showing potential but needing substantial work to address critical gaps. The concept is worthy of further development if these recommendations are addressed."
