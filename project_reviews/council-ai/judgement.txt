    "summary": "Advocate emphasizes the project's strong potential for personal development, impressive technical integration of multiple AI technologies, creative problem-solving, and clear presentation. Key strengths include holistic implementation and practical user value. Critic highlights concerns about cost-prohibitability, scalability issues, reliance on third-party APIs, lack of validation metrics, and potential ethical concerns regarding replacing human counselors.",
    
    "analysis": "Both sides present valid arguments. The project demonstrates technical sophistication and innovative application of AI for personal development, but faces significant practical challenges. The integration of multiple AI technologies shows technical competence, though it also creates dependencies and cost issues. The creative concept builds thoughtfully on existing work, but needs more validation and safety considerations. The presentation is clear but could benefit from more concrete metrics and testing data.",

    "final_verdict": "Council-ai shows promising innovation and solid technical execution, earning a strong overall score despite practical limitations. Recommendations: 1) Develop a sustainable cost model and clear monetization strategy 2) Implement robust safety measures and validation processes 3) Reduce API dependencies where possible 4) Conduct user testing and gather concrete metrics 5) Consider a simplified version that maintains core value while reducing operational costs. The project shows significant potential but needs refinement for practical deployment."
