    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Fluenta AI's potential to revolutionize language learning through immersive AI-driven experiences, strong technical integration, and comprehensive approach. The critic highlights concerns about over-reliance on third-party APIs, lack of user validation, and potential scalability issues.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates innovative use of current AI technologies and addresses a real need in language learning. However, the heavy dependence on external services and lack of demonstrated user validation are legitimate concerns. The technical implementation, while impressive in scope, raises questions about long-term sustainability and scalability. The presentation is thorough but could benefit from more concrete evidence of effectiveness.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "Fluenta AI shows strong promise with a score of 7/10 overall. To improve, the team should:
    1. Develop more proprietary technology to reduce API dependencies
    2. Conduct and document user testing
    3. Provide concrete metrics for effectiveness
    4. Strengthen the backend architecture
    5. Create clearer differentiation from existing solutions

    The project demonstrates innovative thinking and addresses a real need, but requires more development in its technical foundation and validation of its approach. The concept is strong, but implementation needs refinement to ensure long-term viability."
