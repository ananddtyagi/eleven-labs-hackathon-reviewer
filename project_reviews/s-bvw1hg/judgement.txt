    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's potential for democratizing location-based storytelling, strong technical architecture, innovative combination of AI technologies, and clear presentation. The critic highlights concerns about business viability, over-reliance on third-party services, limited technical innovation, and incomplete user experience considerations.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives offer valid points. The project demonstrates strong technical foundation and innovative use of AI technologies, but has notable gaps in business planning and risk management. The technical implementation is modern and well-structured, though heavily dependent on external services. While the core concept is promising, the lack of unique features and market validation raises concerns. The presentation is professional but missing crucial elements like UI demonstrations and business strategy.",
