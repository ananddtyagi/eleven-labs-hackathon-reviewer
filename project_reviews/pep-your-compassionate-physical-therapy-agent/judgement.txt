    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Pep's potential to revolutionize physical therapy adherence through AI-driven engagement, highlighting its technical sophistication, scalability, and user-centric design. The critic raises concerns about oversimplification of healthcare complexities, technical stability issues, regulatory compliance, and lack of professional medical oversight.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project shows innovative potential in combining AI, voice UI, and computer vision for healthcare engagement. The technical implementation demonstrates ambition in integrating complex technologies, though with notable stability issues. While the gamification approach isn't entirely novel, the execution through multi-modal AI interaction is creative. The presentation is clear but lacks crucial details about medical safety and regulatory compliance. The project balances between promising innovation and practical healthcare implementation challenges.",

    "final_verdict": "Pep shows significant promise with a score of 7/10 overall. The project presents an innovative approach to physical therapy adherence, but requires substantial refinement in technical stability and healthcare compliance. Recommendations: 1) Consult with healthcare professionals to validate the approach, 2) Address technical stability issues, 3) Develop clear safety protocols and regulatory compliance strategy, 4) Conduct user testing with actual PT patients, 5) Create more detailed documentation of working features and safety measures. The project should continue development with a focus on these areas while maintaining its creative approach to user engagement."
