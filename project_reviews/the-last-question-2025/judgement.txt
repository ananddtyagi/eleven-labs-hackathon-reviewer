    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's innovative approach to digital storytelling, successful integration of multiple AI technologies, and potential for scalability across literature. They highlight the clean implementation and clear documentation. The critic points out significant resource efficiency concerns, technical limitations, architectural issues, and questions the project's long-term viability and market differentiation.",
    
    "analysis": "Both sides make valid points. The project shows genuine innovation in combining modern AI technologies to transform literary experiences, particularly impressive for a hackathon setting. However, the technical implementation has notable limitations and sustainability concerns. The core concept is promising, but the current execution faces significant challenges regarding costs, architecture, and user experience. The honest self-assessment in the documentation is commendable, though it also reveals many areas needing improvement.",
