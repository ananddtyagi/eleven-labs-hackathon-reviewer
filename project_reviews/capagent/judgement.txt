    "summary": "Advocate highlights: Strong market need (20% turnover), robust technical implementation combining multiple technologies, innovative real-time coaching approach, and clear presentation. Main strengths are practical application potential and immediate market impact. Critic emphasizes: Lack of evidence/testing data, heavy reliance on existing technologies rather than proprietary solutions, potential privacy concerns, and missing concrete metrics/KPIs. Key concerns include over-dependence on AI and insufficient differentiation from existing solutions.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project addresses a genuine market need with a technically feasible solution. However, the implementation relies heavily on third-party services and lacks validation data. The real-time coaching feature is innovative, but privacy and latency concerns need addressing. The presentation is professional but could benefit from more concrete metrics and competitive analysis. The balance lies in recognizing the potential while acknowledging the significant development needed for market readiness.",
