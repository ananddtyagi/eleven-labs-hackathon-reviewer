    "summary": "The Advocate emphasizes ScreenMan's practical value in content creation, highlighting its sophisticated tech stack, impressive response time, and potential to democratize research assistance. They praise the clear presentation and roadmap for future development. The Critic points out concerns about market size, API dependencies, latency issues, lack of technical specifics, and questions the project's true innovation, while raising valid concerns about sustainability and privacy.",
    
    "analysis": "Both sides present valid arguments. The project shows promise in addressing a real need with modern technology, but faces significant technical and business challenges. The implementation is technically impressive but heavily dependent on third-party services. While the innovation may not be groundbreaking, the integration of multiple technologies for a specific use case is noteworthy. The presentation is clear but could benefit from more concrete data and demonstrations.",
