    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes CoCo's potential to revolutionize business consulting through its multi-agent architecture, seamless integration of advanced technologies, and user-friendly interface. They highlight its end-to-end solution capabilities and natural conversation interface as key strengths. The critic points out concerns about practical implementation, including lack of real-world testing, over-reliance on third-party technologies, potential scaling issues, and limited differentiation from existing solutions. Both sides acknowledge the technical sophistication, though they differ on whether this complexity is a strength or limitation.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project shows impressive technical ambition and a clear vision for automating business consulting. However, the critic's concerns about practical implementation and differentiation are significant. The lack of concrete performance metrics, security considerations, and real-world testing data suggests the project may be more conceptual than production-ready. The multi-agent architecture, while sophisticated, could indeed introduce unnecessary complexity. The project's strength lies in its comprehensive approach to automating consulting workflows, but its weakness is in the practical execution and market positioning.",

    "final_verdict": "CoCo demonstrates strong potential with its comprehensive approach to AI-powered business consulting, earning a total weighted score of 7/10. To improve, the team should: 1) Develop a clear differentiation strategy from existing solutions, 2) Implement and document real-world testing results, 3) Streamline the technical architecture to reduce complexity, 4) Address security and privacy concerns, and 5) Provide concrete performance metrics. The project shows promise but needs more practical validation and refinement before it can be considered ready for market deployment."
