    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Quokka's potential to transform online education through AI-enhanced interactive learning, strong technical implementation using modern frameworks, and innovative combination of AI features. They highlight the clear presentation and roadmap for future development. The critic points out concerns about over-dependence on third-party services, lack of proven effectiveness, missing accessibility features, and limited novelty in the core concept. They also note the absence of concrete examples and business model details.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates strong technical foundation and addresses a real need in online education. The implementation using modern technologies and AI integration is impressive. However, the critic raises valid concerns about dependency on external services and lack of proven effectiveness. The project's success would likely depend on addressing these limitations while maintaining its strengths in user experience and AI integration. The lack of differentiation from existing solutions and missing concrete validation are significant concerns that need addressing.",
