    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes Notable's potential to revolutionize customer feedback processing through AI-powered podcast generation, highlighting its modern tech stack, scalable architecture, and clear market understanding. The critic counters by pointing out heavy third-party dependencies, potential information overload, limited innovation beyond format conversion, and lack of concrete security/compliance considerations.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project demonstrates strong technical implementation using current technologies and addresses a real business need. However, concerns about third-party dependencies and security are legitimate. While the podcast format is creative, questions about its effectiveness as a solution are reasonable. The presentation is professional but lacks specific technical details and metrics.",

    "final_verdict": "Notable shows promise as a solution for making customer feedback more accessible, earning a solid overall score of 7/10. To improve, the team should: 1) Reduce third-party dependencies, 2) Add security/compliance measures, 3) Provide concrete metrics on time/cost savings, 4) Consider expanding beyond executive use-case, and 5) Demonstrate clear differentiation from existing solutions. The project has good potential but needs these refinements for enterprise-ready status."
