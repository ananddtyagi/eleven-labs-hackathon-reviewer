    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes IntPod's potential to transform passive podcast consumption into an interactive experience, highlighting its sophisticated tech stack, clear scalability roadmap, and well-structured presentation. The critic points out concerns about unproven market demand, technical implementation issues, reliance on third-party services, and a marketing-heavy approach that may overshadow product development.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project shows promise in its vision to revolutionize podcast consumption, but faces significant technical and market validation challenges. The team demonstrates adaptability in their technical approach, though this also reveals some planning issues. While the interactive concept is innovative, questions about user demand and content quality are legitimate concerns. The presentation is professional but lacks crucial technical details and concrete demonstrations.",
