    "summary": "The Advocate emphasizes the project's potential life-saving impact, strong technical foundation using modern technologies, innovative combination of AI and emergency response, and excellent documentation. The Critic highlights serious concerns about security vulnerabilities, lack of real-world validation, missing critical features, and inadequate risk management considerations.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates impressive technical architecture and addresses a crucial healthcare need. The implementation using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and AI integration shows technical competence. However, the Critic raises valid concerns about security, reliability, and real-world applicability. The plain text password storage and lack of proper error handling are significant issues for an emergency system. The absence of medical professional consultation and regulatory compliance consideration are also noteworthy gaps. The project shows promise but needs substantial refinement for real-world deployment.",

    "final_verdict": "Rescue-Response-AI shows significant promise with its innovative approach to emergency healthcare response, earning a total weighted score of 7/10. Immediate recommendations include: 1) Implement proper security measures including password hashing and JWT authentication, 2) Develop comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms, 3) Consult with healthcare professionals and address regulatory requirements, 4) Add proper testing and validation procedures, 5) Create detailed technical architecture documentation. While the current implementation has limitations, the core concept and technical foundation provide a strong basis for further development into a production-ready solution."
