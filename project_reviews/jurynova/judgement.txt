    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes JuryNova's potential to revolutionize hackathon judging through AI-powered evaluation, highlighting its comprehensive technical implementation, innovative multi-agent approach, and well-documented presentation. The critic raises concerns about over-automation reducing human engagement, heavy dependency on third-party services, lack of real-world validation, and potential standardization issues.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates strong technical ambition and addresses a real problem in hackathon judging. The multi-agent approach is well-thought-out and the implementation uses modern technologies effectively. However, the critic's concerns about over-automation and lack of real-world validation are valid. The project could benefit from finding a better balance between AI assistance and human judgment, while also addressing practical implementation challenges like service dependencies and fallback mechanisms.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "JuryNova shows significant promise with a score of 8/10 overall. The project demonstrates excellent presentation and innovative use of AI technology for hackathon judging. To improve, it should: 1) Implement a hybrid approach that better balances AI assistance with human judgment, 2) Reduce dependencies on external services and add robust fallback mechanisms, 3) Conduct and document real-world testing with hackathon organizers, 4) Address security and privacy concerns more explicitly, and 5) Develop clear metrics for measuring success. Despite these areas for improvement, the project shows strong potential for positive impact in the hackathon ecosystem."
