    "summary": "The advocate highlights AcuHealth AI's potential for global healthcare impact through multilingual accessibility, strong technical implementation using multiple APIs, and innovative combination of voice/text features. They emphasize the well-structured presentation and clear roadmap. The critic points out significant concerns about medical data security, regulatory compliance, lack of real-world validation, heavy API dependencies, and absence of distinctive features compared to existing solutions.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project demonstrates strong potential in addressing language barriers in healthcare, but critical aspects like medical accuracy validation and data security cannot be overlooked. The technical implementation shows sophistication in API integration, but this could also be a vulnerability. While the presentation is well-structured, it lacks concrete metrics and validation data. The project balances innovation with practical implementation, though more focus on healthcare-specific requirements would strengthen its viability.",
