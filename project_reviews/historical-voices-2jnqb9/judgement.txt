    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's educational potential, unique life-stages feature, and solid technical foundation with custom components. They highlight the scalability and practical applications in education. The critic points out incomplete implementation of core features (especially ElevenLabs API), lack of novelty, basic presentation, and insufficient technical innovation. Both acknowledge the time management challenges faced by the team.",
    
    "analysis": "The project shows promise in concept but faces significant execution challenges. While the educational angle and life-stages feature are interesting differentiators, the failure to properly implement voice features (a presumed hackathon requirement) is concerning. The technical foundation appears solid with a custom database and frontend, but the reliance on existing APIs without significant innovation limits its technical impact. The presentation is honest but lacks crucial details and demonstrations that would strengthen their case.",

    "final_verdict": "Historical Voices presents an interesting concept with moderate potential for educational impact. The project scores above average on creativity due to its life-stages feature but falls short on technical implementation and presentation. To improve, the team should:\n1. Complete the ElevenLabs API integration\n2. Develop unique technical features beyond API integration\n3. Add demonstrations and metrics to their presentation\n4. Focus on historical accuracy and data validation\n5. Establish clear differentiation from existing solutions\nThe current implementation is promising but needs significant refinement to reach its full potential."
