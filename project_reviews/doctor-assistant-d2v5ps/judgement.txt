    "summary": "The advocate highlights the project's potential to reduce doctor workload, its well-integrated tech stack, innovative combination of AI with medical practice, and clear presentation. Key strengths include automated task handling, use of authenticated medical databases, and scalability potential. The critic emphasizes concerns about limited scope, security issues, reliance on third-party tools, lack of healthcare compliance, and absence of real-world validation. They also point out the basic nature of features and missing technical details.",
    
    "analysis": "Both sides present valid arguments. The project shows promise in addressing healthcare efficiency, but has significant implementation gaps. The use of authenticated medical databases and multi-modal interaction is impressive, but the heavy reliance on third-party tools and basic security measures are concerning for a healthcare application. While the technical foundation is present, the project needs substantial development in areas of compliance, security, and real-world validation. The scope, while focused, could benefit from expansion while maintaining the current attention to accuracy.",

    },
    
    "final_verdict": "The project demonstrates good potential but requires significant refinement. Primary recommendations include: 1) Implement robust security measures and healthcare compliance standards, 2) Develop more proprietary solutions rather than relying heavily on third-party tools, 3) Expand the scope beyond migraines while maintaining quality, 4) Add comprehensive testing and validation processes, 5) Improve appointment handling capabilities. The project scores above average overall (6.25/10) but needs these improvements before being viable for real-world medical implementation."
