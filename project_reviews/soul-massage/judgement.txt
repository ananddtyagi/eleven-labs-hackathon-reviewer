    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's potential for democratizing mental health support through accessibility, affordability, and 24/7 availability, highlighting its modern tech stack and personal motivation. The critic raises serious concerns about ethical implications, inadequate safeguards, oversimplified approach to mental health, and lack of professional oversight or regulatory compliance.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. While the project addresses a crucial need for affordable mental health support, the critic's concerns about safety, professional oversight, and regulatory compliance are significant. The technical implementation appears basic but functional, though lacking essential security features for healthcare data. The innovation lies more in accessibility than novel technology, but the risks of AI-only therapy without human oversight are concerning. The presentation, while authentic, lacks crucial technical and safety details.",
