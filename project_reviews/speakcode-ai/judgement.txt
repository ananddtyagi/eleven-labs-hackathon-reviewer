    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's strong educational impact potential, particularly for accessibility, its well-structured technical implementation using multiple APIs, and its innovative approach to code education. The critic highlights concerns about reliance on third-party APIs, limited technical innovation, potential scaling issues due to API costs, and lack of concrete user testing or market analysis.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project addresses a genuine need in making coding more accessible, especially for underserved groups. However, the technical implementation, while functional, heavily relies on existing APIs rather than novel solutions. The project shows promise in its educational impact but faces legitimate challenges regarding scalability and business viability. The presentation is clear but could benefit from more concrete data and technical details.",

    "final_verdict": "SpeakCode AI shows strong potential in addressing accessibility in coding education, earning a solid overall score of 7/10. To improve, the team should:
    1. Develop more proprietary technology to reduce API dependencies
    2. Create a clear monetization strategy and address scaling concerns
    3. Conduct user testing and provide concrete metrics
    4. Add unique features beyond basic code explanation
    The project demonstrates good promise but needs refinement in its technical implementation and business strategy to achieve long-term success."
