    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's innovative approach to making online dating more personal through AI-powered virtual personas, strong technical integration, and clear potential for scalability. They highlight the successful implementation of conversational onboarding and the thoughtful solution to superficial judgments in dating apps. The critic points out significant concerns about authentication issues, potential safety risks, lack of novelty, and incomplete implementation. They also emphasize the missing technical details and potential for misuse of AI personas.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project shows promise in addressing the impersonal nature of dating apps through innovative technology, but also faces legitimate technical and safety challenges. The implementation demonstrates technical capability through the integration of multiple advanced technologies, though the authentication issues and SDK problems indicate areas needing improvement. While the concept is creative, the critic's point about existing AI chatbots in dating apps suggests the innovation may be incremental rather than revolutionary. The presentation is clear but could benefit from more detailed technical documentation and concrete examples.",
