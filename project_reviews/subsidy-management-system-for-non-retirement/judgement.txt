    "summary": "The advocate emphasizes the project's strong social impact potential, technical integration of modern technologies, and innovative approach to solving retirement subsidy distribution. Key strengths include scalability, user-centric design, and government application potential. The critic highlights significant concerns about security, real-world validation, implementation details, and the lack of concrete metrics and partnerships. They also question the sustainability and practical viability of the solution.",
    
    "analysis": "Both perspectives raise valid points. The project addresses a critical social issue with a technically feasible solution. However, there are legitimate concerns about implementation details, security, and real-world viability. The use of modern technologies is impressive, but the over-reliance on third-party APIs and lack of security considerations are significant weaknesses. The project shows promise but requires substantial development to become a practical solution.",

    "final_verdict": "The project demonstrates good potential but requires significant refinement before real-world implementation. Key recommendations: 1) Develop comprehensive security protocols, 2) Create clear metrics for measuring impact, 3) Establish partnerships with government agencies, 4) Define detailed selection criteria, 5) Build robust error handling and failover systems, 6) Create a detailed implementation and sustainability plan. While the concept is promising, the current state is more proof-of-concept than production-ready solution. The team should focus on addressing the identified gaps while maintaining the positive aspects of their social impact focus and technical integration capabilities."
