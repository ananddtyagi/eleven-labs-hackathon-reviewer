    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Products like Storylane and Supademo use HTML and CSS sandboxed environments to provide step-by-step guides. The problem with these platforms is that business owners need to configure and maintain multiple guides for every specific use case, predicting what users might ask about their platform. Additionally, many of these guides have overlapping steps, yet each one must be maintained separately, leading to repetitive work.</p>\n<p>Gibble AI solves this problem by allowing you to teach it about your platform once, after which it autonomously provides interactive demos and answers complex questions through a conversational voice agent.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>In addition to offering product guides, Gibble AI serves as a proof of concept (PoC) for your product. It answers repetitive queries that business owners might otherwise need to handle manually, reducing both bounce rate and churn rate.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Gibble AI leverages LiveKit\u2019s WebRTC infrastructure for real-time conversations, Deepgram for speech-to-text (STT), OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o as the LLM, and Eleven Labs for voice synthesis. The LiveKit server is securely hosted using Docker on an AWS EC2 instance. The frontend is built with Next.js and ShadCN for quick prototyping and UI development.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One major challenge was deploying the LiveKit agent, as LiveKit uses the UDP protocol for networking. I spent about 1.5 hours troubleshooting this issue, but once I figured it out, everything worked smoothly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>I successfully completed the hackathon challenge and now have a deployed version of Gibble AI that I can present to potential VCs to secure funding for further development.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Through this process, I gained valuable experience in real-time communication technologies, cloud deployment, and optimizing AI-driven voice interactions for business applications.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Gibble AI</h2>\n<p>The next step for Gibble AI is to build a platform where users can train it on their website using a Chrome extension. This extension will allow business owners to explain their platform like a real person, making the onboarding process seamless. Additionally, we plan to scale the system to handle more users efficiently.</p>\n</div>",

    "critic": "Here's my critical analysis of Gibble AI based on the judging rubric:\n\nImpact (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- The project doesn't demonstrate clear metrics or data on how it would actually reduce bounce and churn rates\n- No clear monetization strategy or business model presented\n- Scalability concerns when handling multiple concurrent voice conversations\n- Potential privacy concerns regarding website data collection not addressed\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- Heavy reliance on third-party services (LiveKit, Deepgram, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) creates multiple points of failure\n- UDP protocol issues suggest potential ongoing networking challenges\n- No mention of error handling or fallback mechanisms\n- Lack of details about how the AI training process actually works\n- Security measures for the AWS deployment not elaborated\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- The core concept is essentially combining existing technologies rather than true innovation\n- Similar to existing solutions like Storylane and Supademo, just with voice added\n- The AI training process through Chrome extension seems potentially superficial\n- No truly unique technological breakthrough presented\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- Project description is vague about specific technical details\n- No demonstration or screenshots provided\n- Limited information about user testing or validation\n- Challenges section focuses on just one minor deployment issue\n- No clear differentiation from competitors beyond voice capability\n- Missing concrete examples of use cases\n\nMajor Areas for Improvement:\n1. Need to demonstrate actual working prototype results\n2. Should address data privacy and security concerns\n3. Require more robust technical architecture documentation\n4. Need clear metrics for measuring success\n5. Should include user testing feedback\n6. Must develop unique selling proposition beyond voice interface\n7. Need contingency plans for service dependencies\n8. Should provide more specific details about AI training methodology\n\nOverall, while the concept has potential, the project appears to be in a very early stage with significant gaps in both technical implementation and business planning. The heavy reliance on third-party services without clear differentiation makes it vulnerable to competition and technical issues.",
    "judgement": "{\n    \"summary\": \"The advocate emphasizes Gibble AI's potential to revolutionize product onboarding and customer support through AI-driven voice interactions, highlighting its modern tech stack and clear business value. The critic points out concerns about over-reliance on third-party services, lack of concrete metrics, and insufficient differentiation from existing solutions.\",\n    \n    \"analysis\": \"Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates strong potential in combining modern technologies to address a real business need. The technical implementation shows competence in integrating various services, though this could also be a vulnerability. While the voice-based approach is interesting, the project needs more concrete validation and differentiation. The presentation is professional but lacks crucial details about implementation and metrics.\",\n    \n    \"scores\": {\n        \"impact\": 7,\n        \"technical_implementation\": 6,\n        \"creativity_and_innovation\": 6,\n        \"pitch_and_presentation\": 7\n    },\n    \n    \"final_verdict\": \"Gibble AI shows promise but requires further development. Recommendations: 1) Develop fallback mechanisms for third-party service dependencies, 2) Conduct and document user testing with clear metrics, 3) Strengthen differentiation beyond voice features, 4) Address privacy and security concerns, 5) Create detailed technical documentation including AI training methodology. The project earns a combined score of 6.5/10, indicating good potential but needing significant refinement before being ready for market or investment.\"\n}",
