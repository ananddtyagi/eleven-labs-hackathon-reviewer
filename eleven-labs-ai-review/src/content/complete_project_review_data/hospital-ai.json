    "project_details": "<div>\n<p>About the Project</p>\n<p>This project is a comprehensive healthcare assistant app designed specifically for doctors. It integrates cutting\u2010edge AI from OpenAI with Firebase for real-time data and PostHog for detailed user analytics to support clinical decision-making.</p>\n<p>Inspiration &amp; Objectives</p>\n<p>Doctors often face overwhelming data and time pressure when diagnosing and treating patients. This project was inspired by the need for a tool that not only provides predictive insights\u2014such as risk assessments, differential diagnoses, and treatment recommendations\u2014but also monitors user interactions to continuously improve the app\u2019s usability. By integrating PostHog, we capture rich analytics on how doctors interact with the app, allowing us to optimize features and ensure the tool meets clinical needs.</p>\n<p>What I Learned</p>\n<p>AI Clinical Support: Leveraging OpenAI\u2019s API to generate concise, evidence-based clinical recommendations.</p>\n<p>Real-Time Data Management: Using Firebase for secure authentication and dynamic data updates.</p>\n<p>User Analytics with PostHog: Tracking events and user behavior to refine and personalize the doctor\u2019s experience.</p>\n<p>UI/UX Design: Creating a clean, responsive interface with a consistent green-and-white color scheme tailored for busy medical professionals.</p>\n<p>How It Works</p>\n<p>User Interface: The mobile app, built with Flutter, includes screens for login, patient management, chat, and various clinical tools.</p>\n<p>Clinical Tools: Doctors can assess patient risk, summarize clinical notes, generate differential diagnoses, check medication interactions, and get treatment recommendations\u2014all powered by AI.</p>\n<p>Analytics &amp; Feedback: PostHog is integrated to capture events such as screen views, button taps, note edits, and consultation milestones. This data drives improvements and ensures the app stays aligned with the real needs of clinicians.</p>\n<p>Demo Account</p>\n<p>You can use the following demo account to explore the app:</p>\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:demo@example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">demo@example.com</a></p>\n<p>Password: Demo1234</p>\n<p>Disclaimer and Legal Notice</p>\n<p>Important Notice: This application is currently under trial and is intended solely for experimental and demonstration purposes within the scope of this competition. It is not a substitute for professional clinical judgment, comprehensive clinical trials, or direct patient care.</p>\n<p>Not a Clinical Replacement: The recommendations and insights provided by this app are generated by AI and are meant to assist doctors, not replace their expertise or the need for thorough clinical evaluations.</p>\n<p>User Responsibility: Any use of the application is at the sole discretion and risk of the user. The developers and associated parties are not liable for any decisions made based on the information provided by the app.</p>\n<p>Data and Compliance: All data used in this project is either simulated or anonymized for demonstration purposes. The project adheres to current data protection guidelines; however, it is not intended for live clinical use without proper regulatory approvals.</p>\n<p>No Endorsement of Medical Decisions: The application\u2019s outputs should be considered as supportive insights and not definitive medical advice. Always consult appropriate clinical resources and professionals when making healthcare decisions.</p>\n<p>Overall, this project is a fusion of modern AI, real-time data, and advanced analytics that aims to empower doctors and improve patient care, while clearly stating its experimental nature and limitations regarding clinical use.</p>\n</div>",
