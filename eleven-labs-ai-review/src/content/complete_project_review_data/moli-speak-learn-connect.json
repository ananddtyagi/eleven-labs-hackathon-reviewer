Many learners struggle with hesitation, lack of confidence, and reliance on translations. Existing apps often focus on grammar and vocabulary but fail to provide immersive speaking practice. Moli was born from the need for a conversation-first AI coach that helps users think and respond naturally in German, without the crutch of translations.</p>\n<p><strong>What it does</strong></p>\n<p>Moli is an AI-powered German-speaking coach designed to build fluency through real-time conversations, instant feedback, and adaptive learning. It listens, corrects, and guides learners as they speak, helping them express themselves naturally without translating from English. Key features include:\n    \u2022 Real-time AI conversation for immersive practice\n    \u2022 Instant feedback\n    \u2022 Adaptive AI that tracks mistakes and suggests improvements\n    \u2022 Real-time hints to guide the user\n    \u2022 Engagement-based learning, ensuring users build confidence in speaking</p>\n<p><strong>How we built it:</strong></p>\n<p>Moli was developed using a combination of:\n    \u2022 Fal.AI for real-time speech processing\n    \u2022 LLMs for conversational AI and correction analysis\n    \u2022 Supabase for storing user interactions and session history\n    \u2022 Lovable\n    \u2022 Elevenlabs conversational AI\n    \u2022 Posthog\n    \u2022 Make</p>\n<p>By integrating these technologies, we built an AI agent that engages in meaningful conversations, provides dynamic corrections, and helps users track their growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges we ran into:</strong>\n    \u2022 ElevenLabs - Credits quickly consumed while testing with audio \n               - Solved this by using a textual transcript as mock for building UI features. \n               - Saved Time and Cost\n    \u2022 Hard to decide where to place the tool calling - Frontend Vs ElevenLabs\n               - Went with Lovable created EdgeFunctions in Supabase \n    \u2022 Time constraints: Building a working prototype with real-time interaction in just two days!\n                - Lovable to the rescue! - Built 100% no-code\n                - Saved Time and Energy, achieved powerful features quickly\n    \u2022 Finding right model - to get necessary JSON outputs\n                - Created UI Configurable Settings\n                - Brought flexibility and Supported with Debugging</p>\n<p><strong>Accomplishments that we\u2019re proud of</strong>\n    \u2022 A fully functional AI conversation coach within the hackathon timeframe.\n    \u2022 Real-time corrections and feedback that help users speak naturally.\n    \u2022 A conversation-first approach, moving away from traditional translation-based learning.\n    \u2022 Learnt tools that are completely new - very quickly - PostHog, Loveable, ElevenLabs, fal, SupabseEdgeFunctions\n    \u2022 Equipped well for future hackathons and personal projects\n    \u2022 Built confidence in AI Tools</p>\n<p>What\u2019s next for Moli - Speak. Learn. Connect\n    \u2022 Expand to more languages, making it a universal AI-speaking coach.\n    \u2022 Improve AI correction logic</p>\n<p>Moli is just getting started!
