Memoras safeguards that legacy, allowing future generations to learn from and interact with a faithfully recreated presence.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Data Overload Without Meaningful Context</strong><br/>\nScrolling through endless photos and posts can be overwhelming. By curating and presenting key moments and stories, Memoras transforms raw data into an engaging, narrative-driven experience.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h2>How It's Made: Phase 1 \u2014 Generating the User Pattern <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h2>\n<h3>1. Basic Information <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Input</strong><br/>\nWe collect basic info from the user like name, date of birth and profile picture, just as metadata.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Video Processing <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Collection</strong><br/>\nWe ask the user to record a 10-seconds video looking straight to the camera and speaking a defined text.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Processing</strong><br/>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Audio Extraction</strong><br/>\nUsing <a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">FFmpeg</a>, we extract the audio track from the user's 10-second video.<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Voice Cloning</strong><br/>\nThis audio is then processed through the <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">ElevenLabs</a> API to create a synthetic voice profile for the user.<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Video Storage</strong><br/>\nThe original video is retained for use in future stages of video generation (e.g., lip-syncing).</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Social Media Data Import <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Data Collection</strong><br/>\nThe user exports their Facebook/Instagram data as a ZIP file containing multiple files (json, webm, mp4, webp...), detailing the user activity regarding posts, comments, likes, connections, inbox messages, ads, and more. Every activity type is parsed and stored in a specialized database. Even users with low social media usage can end up with ~150 tables cataloging their digital footprint. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Data Processing</strong> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>JSON Files</strong><br/>\nThey are parsed and stored in two ways: structured data is stored in a SQL database, while unstructured data is stored in a vector database.</li>\n<li><strong>Image Files</strong><br/>\nFor images (e.g., stories and post images), we use the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/blip\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLIP model</a> to generate descriptive captions. These descriptions, along with file metadata, are saved in the database.<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Video Files</strong><br/>\nWe extract key frames from each video and apply the image process to generate textual descriptions. A summarization algorithm then condenses these descriptions into a concise overview of the video's content.<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Audio Files</strong><br/>\nAudio recordings are transcribed using <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/whisper\" rel=\"nofollow\">Whisper</a>, producing textual descriptions for each file.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. User Description Generation <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Analyzer Agent</strong><br/>\nAfter all data is consolidated, our LLM-powered agent performs a thorough analysis to create a multi-layered user profile. It focuses on three key outputs:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>User's Bio</strong> (\u2248500 characters)<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Full Description</strong> (\u22483000 characters)<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Speech Pattern Analysis</strong><br/>\n A detailed breakdown of the user's intonations, pauses, and other non-verbal cues to ensure authenticity in voice reproduction.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once this phase is complete, the user's Memora is ready to become an interactive, AI-driven representation of their identity.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>How It's Made: Phase 2 \u2014 Conversation <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h2>\n<p>When a user initiates a dialogue with a Memora, the system employs an <strong>Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong> approach. This ensures responses accurately reflect the user's personality, history, and preferences by drawing on the user's <strong>profile</strong> and <strong>database</strong>. The conversation flow typically unfolds as follows:</p>\n<h3>1. Answer generation <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The user's query is analyzed against their consolidated data\u2014posts, comments, likes, and any other relevant information\u2014to form a contextually appropriate response.<br/></li>\n<li>An LLM then composes the final text, weaving together personal details and communication style captured during Phase 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Audio Output <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The text response is passed through the user's <strong>voice cloning model</strong> (powered by <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">ElevenLabs</a>) to produce an audio output that sounds just like the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Video Output <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If a video response is requested, we leverage the <a href=\"https://fal.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fal-AI lip-sync</a> model to sync the user's cloned voice with their original video footage.<br/></li>\n<li>This process merges the synthetic audio with visual cues\u2014resulting in a fully animated, lifelike video response. You can see an example of final video generation <a href=\"https://v3.fal.media/files/zebra/qxgYQ9ZN9W1CffXPFEGgB_2b46badb-4b08-4581-a5f2-c0e00b288764_output.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This comprehensive system allows Memoras to deliver replies that feel authentic and personal, transforming static data into interactive, human-like conversations.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Other Important Features <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Languages</strong><br/>\nMemoras supports multiple languages, allowing users to interact and retrieve data in their native tongue. This language-agnostic approach ensures a seamless experience regardless of the user's linguistic background.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Intelligent Information Retrieval</strong><br/>\nBy harnessing both SQL queries and vector databases, Memoras can handle complex user queries. It accurately interprets intent and pinpoints the most relevant information within the user's extensive data.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Share &amp; Explore</strong><br/>\nUsers can explore publicly available Memoras, engaging in conversations with digital personas of other individuals. For private Memoras, owners can selectively share access with specific people, maintaining control over who can interact.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Privacy &amp; Data Security</strong><br/>\nAt Memoras, safeguarding personal information is paramount. We implement robust guardrails to prevent the disclosure of sensitive data during conversations, ensuring users can trust the platform with their most precious memories.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Tech Stack <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h2>\n<h3>Backend <a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.python.org/\"
