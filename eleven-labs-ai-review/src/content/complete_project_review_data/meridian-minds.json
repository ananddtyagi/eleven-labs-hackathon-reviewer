    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Inspiration</strong></h2>\n<p>Patients have a difficult time ordering and filling their prescriptions. The current process takes too long and is inefficient. We think we can improve lives and save time with agents!</p>\n<h2><strong>What it does</strong></h2>\n<p>AI-powered medication concierge that simplifies prescription management in the UK by automating refill tracking, booking GP appointments, and assisting with communication where needed.</p>\n<h2><strong>How we built it</strong></h2>\n<p>By creating a customer flow in tldraw once we gathered information from various medical articles from the UK. We then  created the information architecture  data schema by utilizing the platform claude artifacts. We used lovable, to create the whole webapp, while utilizing  supabase database of prescriptions, pharmacies, users, doctors, login, and data management for Elevenlabs, we used the conversational AI functionality to integrate medical data about the patient and also about UK prescription drugs and deep medical info for easy retrieval through multilanguage agents easily</p>\n<h2><strong>Challenges we ran into</strong></h2>\n<p>Some of the files utilized do not  align with the AI Agent\u2019s actual goal.  Certain files initially utilized contained unrelated data, such as digital clinical safety files, for better vectorization.  As this was an hackathon we first took on multiple pain points, but had to scale back for the scope of the mvp Instead of tackling multiple issues at once, we directed efforts towards a single problem with a well-defined solution.</p>\n<h2><strong>Accomplishments that we're proud of</strong></h2>\n<p>Creating a fully functional  AI Agent that  was able to not hallucinate from an actual working knowledge base and retrieve and communicate in natural language critical and accurate info that was led and confirmed by a licensed pharmacist.  Also, the medication list was a 2000-page pdf and it actually worked with almost no latency using a local embedding model and a self-hosted Milvus vector database. As well as diving into a problem and creating a concept that could potentially help patients' pain points in the long run.</p>\n<h2><strong>What we learned</strong></h2>\n<p>We must further deep dive into Patient\u2019s pain points by developing more solutions that address their needs while considering the broader healthcare ecosystem and enhancing scalability. Work with GP surgeries, community pharmacies, and Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) to reduce health disparities, improve scalability, and address medication compliance challenges highlighted in the 2021 overprescribing report.</p>\n<h2><strong>What's next for Meridian-Minds</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>AI-ASSISTED COMMUNICATION:</strong>\nEnable the AI Agent to call GP surgeries and community pharmacies when relevant, ensuring seamless patient communication and care coordination.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION:</strong>\nIntegrate with platforms like Dr IQ (Evergreen), Pharmacy2U, and Patient Access (EMIS) to streamline patient services and medication management.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>SMART APPOINTMENT BOOKING:</strong>\nFacilitate booking of GP appointments, blood tests (via Swiftqueue), and medication reviews through direct patient calendar connections.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Bloopers/Outtakes</strong></h2>\n<p>We tried testing our agent in multiple languages....\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BotGKiZBkeE&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BotGKiZBkeE&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>\n<p>NOTE: One of the team members could not join in devpost.com but is registered:\nArun Nadarasa: <a href=\"mailto:socialprescribing@yahoo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">socialprescribing@yahoo.com</a>\nContributions: NHS clinical expert and entrepreneur with knowledge to curate our RAG and prepare documents for embedding.

Clear vision for future development and integration\n5. Focus on user accessibility and ease of use\n\nThe project demonstrates excellent potential for real-world implementation and scaling, with a solid technical foundation and clear understanding of the healthcare ecosystem. The team's ability to create a working prototype with accurate medical information handling is particularly impressive.",
    "critic": "Here's a critical analysis of the Meridian-Minds project, focusing on potential issues and areas of improvement:\n\nImpact (25% weight) - Major Concerns:\n- Limited initial scope focusing only on UK healthcare system, which restricts global scalability\n- Heavy dependence on integration with existing healthcare systems could create adoption barriers\n- No clear monetization strategy or business model presented\n- Lacks concrete evidence of patient testing or real-world validation\n- Potential privacy and security concerns with handling sensitive medical data not adequately addressed\n\nTechnical Implementation (25% weight) - Weaknesses:\n- Over-reliance on third-party integrations that haven't been secured yet\n- Limited details about the AI model's training and validation process\n- No mention of error handling or fallback mechanisms\n- Unclear how the system handles edge cases or emergency situations\n- The local embedding model might face scalability issues with larger datasets\n- Security measures for protecting sensitive medical information not specified\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25% weight) - Limitations:\n- Similar solutions already exist in the market (like Pharmacy2U and Patient Access)\n- The core concept of medication management is not particularly novel\n- The multilanguage feature, while useful, appears to be more of a gimmick than a core functionality\n- Limited innovation in terms of solving the underlying healthcare system issues\n- Doesn't address the root causes of prescription management problems\n\nPitch and Presentation (25% weight) - Areas for Improvement:\n- Project description lacks specific technical details and architecture diagrams\n- No clear metrics or KPIs for measuring success\n- Missing demonstration of actual user interface or user experience\n- Limited information about team expertise and roles\n- No clear timeline for implementing future features\n- Absence of market analysis or competitive positioning\n\nAdditional Critical Points:\n1. The project seems to have been developed in a very short timeframe (approximately 36 hours), which raises questions about its robustness and completeness\n2. The team composition appears incomplete with one member not properly registered\n3. The focus on UK healthcare system specifics might make it difficult to adapt to other markets\n4. The reliance on multiple third-party integrations creates significant dependencies and potential points of failure\n5. No clear regulatory compliance strategy presented for handling medical data\n\nIn conclusion, while the project addresses a real problem, it appears to be more of a concept than a fully realized solution. The technical implementation seems basic, and there are significant challenges to overcome before it could be considered viable for real-world deployment. The team would need to address these fundamental issues and provide more concrete evidence of feasibility before this could be considered a serious contender in the healthcare technology space.",
