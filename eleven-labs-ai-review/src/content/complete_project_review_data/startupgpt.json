    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>While following YC startups and Hacker News, Mani and I noticed companies like Crustdata (live company data APIs) and Juicebox (AI-powered talent sourcing) gaining traction, with Crustdata\u2019s founder being a friend\u2019s husband. Seeing them raise funding and attract 200+ customers, we wondered: How hard would it be to replicate their core functionality but with a novel focus\u2014\"AI-powered startup scouting for investors?\"</p>\n<p>With <strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong> as a hackathon sponsor and accelerator partner, we recognized that while a16z-backed startups unlock countless opportunities, investors still struggle to efficiently scout, assess, and connect with them. To solve this, we built StartupGPT in less than 8 hours, creating an AI-driven and Agentic  voice-activated scouting platform where AI agents handle everything from NLP-powered search and ranking to real-time insights and automated outreach.\n<strong>Features</strong>\nAI-Powered Startup Search \u2013 Instantly find startups by simply describing what you're looking for.\nIntelligent Startup Insights \u2013 Get real-time data on founders, funding, traction, and risks.\nAI-Driven Investment Thesis Matching \u2013 Rank startups based on your unique investment criteria.\nCompetitive Landscape Analysis \u2013 Compare startups with competitors using AI-driven insights.\nAutomated Outreach &amp; Follow-Ups \u2013 AI drafts personalized emails and tracks responses effortlessly.\nConversational AI Interface \u2013 Simply talk to AI instead of manually searching databases.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>StartupGPT</strong> is a  <strong>AI-powered agentic scouting platform</strong> that helps <strong>VC's and angel investors</strong> discover, analyze, and engage with startups using a <strong>conversational AI interface</strong>. Every step of the process is powered by <strong>AI agents</strong>, from <strong>NLP-driven search</strong> to data aggregation, and even automating investor outreach. Using <strong>Eleven Labs AI voice tools</strong>, investors can simply ask, -\u201cFind AI startups that raised over $1M\u201d, and <strong>StartupGPT</strong> dynamically retrieves, ranks, and summarizes relevant startups in real time. <strong>AI agents handle everything</strong> query interpretation, data parsing, automated insights, and personalized follow-ups making startup scouting as seamless as a conversation. With <strong>Generative UI</strong>, investors get an intuitive, interactive experience, allowing them to explore opportunities effortlessly and find the next unicorn \ud83e\udd84</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>Real-Time Data Aggregation \u2013 Ensuring that StartupGPT fetches accurate and up-to-date information from multiple sources without lag using People Data Labs , Firecrawl and Perplexity AI.\nAI Agent Coordination \u2013 Seamlessly integrating AI agents and multi agent orchestration for search, analysis, and outreach while maintaining a conversational flow.\nVoice Activation &amp; Responsiveness \u2013 Optimizing the voice interface to handle complex queries while keeping interactions natural.\nScalability in Search &amp; Matching \u2013 Designing an AI-powered ranking system that dynamically updates as new startups emerge.\nBuilding Under Time Constraints \u2013 We aimed to develop a fully functional product within just 8 hours at the hackathon, pushing ourselves to see how well we perform under pressure.\nUI Challenges \u2013 Ensuring smooth updates and dynamic management of tool responses as they varied across different websites and companies proved to be a complex task.\nLLM Models \u2013 Models like Perplexity and OpenAI exhibited emerging capabilities, and we sought to leverage those strengths effectively.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>Fully Functional working MVP in 8 Hours \u2013 From idea to execution, we built a working AI-driven scouting platform in record time.\nAI Agents Everywhere \u2013 Successfully automated even small tasks, ensuring investors get a seamless experience.\nConversational AI for Investors \u2013 Making startup scouting as easy as talking to an AI assistant.\nAutomated Outreach &amp; Follow-ups \u2013 Investors can engage with founders instantly with personalized communication.\nSmart Insights &amp; Red Flags Detection \u2013 AI not only finds startups but also highlights risks and opportunities dynamically.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>AI Agents Unlock Efficiency \u2013 By using AI for every step, from discovery to outreach, investors can move faster than ever.\nInvestors Need Real-Time Insights \u2013 Static databases aren\u2019t enough\u2014continuous monitoring of startups is essential.\nConversational Interfaces Are Game-Changers \u2013 Talking to an AI is far more intuitive than using filters and manual searches.\nThe Market Is Hungry for Better Scouting Tools \u2013 Seeing existing players like Crustdata and Juicebox succeed reinforced our belief in the demand for smarter scouting solutions.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for StartupGPT?</h2>\n<p>Let me answer in one sentence \"Cover every startup and  founder on the planet\" :)\nExpand Data Sources \u2013 Integrate with platforms like Crunchbase, LinkedIn, and private deal flows to improve startup discovery.\nEnhance AI\u2019s Decision-Making \u2013 Train our AI agents to predict investment potential based on market trends and founder credibility.\nMore Personalization \u2013 Let investors set detailed investment theses and have AI refine recommendations accordingly.\nInvestor Network &amp; Collaboration \u2013 Allow VC's and angels to share insights and co-invest in promising startups.\nScaling Beyond Hackathon \u2013 Turn this into a fully-fledged product and explore partnerships with accelerators like a16z and YC-backed startups.</p>\n</div>",
