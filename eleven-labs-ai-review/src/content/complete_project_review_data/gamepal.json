I have spent hours on my computer playing games like <em>Doom</em> and <em>Duke Nukem</em>, as well as puzzle games like <em>Myst</em>.</p>\n<p>More often than I would like to admit, I got stuck in games and could not make any progress.\nThis is where I would go to the newspaper stand and buy video game magazines. Those magazines they had pages and pages of walkthroughs, describing every single quest and all the different cheat codes to progress faster in the game.</p>\n<p>This was my entry into programming: finding the console in The Sims, entering <em>rosebud</em>, and then opening a world of modding. \ud83e\udd29</p>\n<p>Before the magazines, there were hotlines you could call, and real video game experts on the other side would give you hints on how to progress.</p>\n<p>I wanted to recreate this so today's gamers could experience a similar <em>thrill</em> while they play.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Gamepal is an agent specifically trained on walkthroughs available online, such as the amazing <a href=\"https://www.zeldadungeon.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zeldadungeon</a> for all Zelda games.</p>\n<p>You can ask questions about the game you are currently playing, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>What is the recipe for a stamina elixir?</p></li>\n<li><p>Where can I find the Chaas Qeta shrine?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is there a cheat code to obtain full hearts?</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Gamepal knows the answer, it will reference its knowledge base; otherwise, it will search the internet to find it.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app UI has been built using <a href=\"https://lovable.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lovable</a></p>\n<p>The agent interaction is built on top of <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elevenlabs Conversational AI</a>.</p>\n<p>Knowledge comes from crawling via <a href=\"https://www.firecrawl.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firecrawl</a> or on-demand search via a make scenario that is calling <a href=\"https://exa.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exa API</a></p>\n<p>Finally, I used Supabase for all the user authentication and databases need.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Elevenlabs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>prompting the agent correctly to trigger the client's tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-docs/pull/794\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opened PR on Elevenlabs doc</a></p>\n<p>Built something visually appealing</p>\n<p>discovered new tools like Exa and Firecrawl</p>\n<p>have a better understanding of conversation agent</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to create and guide apps with Lovable</p>\n<p>How to build a conversational agent with Elevenlabs</p>\n<p>How to crawl and search using Exa and Firecrawl</p>\n<h2>What's next for Gamepal</h2>\n<p>If I had more time, I could have connected it to a real Twilio number, so really re-enact the original experience. Right now it's only connected to a test number</p>\n<p>Also, I would love to build a way to augment the knowledge base automatically so it does not have to search the web.</p>\n</div>",

    "critic": "Here's my critical analysis of the Gamepal project based on the judging rubric:\n\nImpact (25%):\n- Weaknesses:\n  * Limited market appeal as modern gamers have instant access to online walkthroughs, YouTube guides, and Reddit communities\n  * Doesn't offer significant advantages over existing solutions like GameFAQs or game-specific wikis\n  * The nostalgia angle might not resonate with younger gamers\n  * No clear monetization strategy or business model presented\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%):\n- Areas of Concern:\n  * Heavy reliance on third-party tools and services (Lovable, Firecrawl, Exa API, Supabase) creates multiple potential points of failure\n  * Limited technical details about how the knowledge base is structured and maintained\n  * No mention of handling game updates or new content releases\n  * Unclear how accurate or up-to-date the crawled information would be\n  * The challenge section only mentions one minor issue, suggesting possible lack of thorough testing\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%):\n- Critical Points:\n  * The concept is essentially a chatbot wrapper around existing game guides\n  * Does not introduce truly innovative features beyond basic Q&A functionality\n  * The nostalgia angle feels forced and doesn't add practical value\n  * Missing opportunities for more interactive features like screenshots, video integration, or real-time game state awareness\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%):\n- Shortcomings:\n  * Project description focuses too much on personal nostalgia rather than project value\n  * Lacks concrete metrics or user testing results\n  * Missing technical architecture diagrams or detailed implementation explanations\n  * No clear target audience definition or market analysis\n  * Future plans are very limited and don't address core functionality improvements\n\nAdditional Concerns:\n- Potential copyright issues with crawling and repurposing content from game guide websites\n- No mention of handling multiple languages or regional game versions\n- Scalability concerns when dealing with multiple games and constant content updates\n- Privacy considerations regarding user data and game progress tracking not addressed\n- No mention of error handling or content verification processes\n\nThe project seems more like a proof of concept than a fully realized solution, with significant gaps in both technical implementation and business viability. While the nostalgic inspiration is interesting, it doesn't translate into a compelling modern product that offers clear advantages over existing solutions.",
    "judgement": "{\n    \"summary\": \"The advocate emphasizes Gamepal's nostalgic appeal combined with modern technology, highlighting its solid technical implementation using multiple modern tools and potential for scaling. They praise its solution to gaming assistance needs and clear project presentation. The critic counters that existing solutions already serve this need better, questions the technical implementation's robustness, and raises concerns about content rights, maintenance, and genuine innovation beyond basic chatbot functionality.\",\n    \n    \"analysis\": \"Both perspectives raise valid points. The project shows promise in its technical architecture and emotional appeal, but faces significant practical challenges. While the integration of AI with gaming assistance is innovative, the reliance on crawled content and lack of unique features beyond Q&A limit its competitive advantage. The technical implementation is comprehensive but potentially fragile due to multiple dependencies. The presentation effectively communicates the vision but lacks crucial business and technical details.\",\n    \n    \"scores\": {\n        \"impact\": 6,\n        \"technical_implementation\": 7,\n        \"creativity_and_innovation\": 6,\n        \"pitch_and_presentation\": 7\n    },\n    \n    \"final_verdict\": \"Gamepal demonstrates solid technical execution and clear presentation, earning a respectable overall score of 6.5/10. To improve, the team should: 1) Develop unique features that differentiate it from existing solutions, 2) Address content rights and maintenance concerns, 3) Reduce third-party dependencies, 4) Create a clear business model, and 5) Add interactive features like screenshot analysis or real-time game integration. The project has potential but needs significant refinement to become a viable product.\"\n}",
