    "project_details": "<div>\n<p>Inspiration</p>\n<p>The idea for BIG BALL sprang from my love of quirky game NPCs and a desire to breathe life into a simple blob with personality and interactivity. I envisioned a wobbly, chatty companion to banish boredom, inspired by animated characters and the magic of AI-powered audio to make even a shapeless blob feel vibrant and engaging.</p>\n<p>What it does</p>\n<p>BIG BALL is an interactive webpage starring a 3D blob that talks back in real time. Users type messages, and the blob responds with lively, AI-generated speech via ElevenLabs\u2019 Conversational AI API. While I aimed for the blob to jiggle in sync with its voice, I ended up with a static (but still charming) blob that chats dynamically, keeping boredom at bay with its playful responses.</p>\n<p>How I built it</p>\n<p>I kicked off with a blob crafted in Spline, embedding it into my webpage with Spline\u2019s script tag. Using Lovable.dev, I prompted the platform to set up a text input field, connect to ElevenLabs\u2019 Conversational AI API for real-time speech, and integrate a conversational AI to generate replies. I streamed the audio through ElevenLabs and tried to use the Web Audio API to drive a jiggle effect via Spline\u2019s jiggleAmount variable, but when that didn\u2019t pan out, I focused on nailing the conversational flow instead.</p>\n<p>Challenges I ran into</p>\n<p>The biggest hurdle was getting the blob to jiggle\u2014I couldn\u2019t get Spline\u2019s jiggleAmount variable to sync properly with the audio waveform, despite wrestling with the runtime API and Web Audio integration. The Spline embed\u2019s limitations made animation tricky, and debugging Lovable.dev\u2019s auto-generated code added headaches, especially when the ElevenLabs audio stream lagged or misfired. Balancing these moving parts tested my patience!</p>\n<p>Accomplishments that I\u2019m proud of</p>\n<p>I\u2019m stoked to have a talking blob that responds in real time\u2014it\u2019s a fun, interactive win even without the jiggle. Successfully tying together Spline, ElevenLabs, and Lovable.dev into a cohesive experience feels huge. I\u2019m especially proud of the blob\u2019s personality shining through its voice (think \u201cI\u2019m your blob pal, here to chill!\u201d), making it a delight to chat with.</p>\n<p>What I learned</p>\n<p>I got a crash course in real-time audio streaming with ElevenLabs and the Web Audio API, plus the quirks of Spline embeds\u2014turns out variables aren\u2019t as plug-and-play as I hoped. Lovable.dev taught me how AI-driven tools can speed up development (and where they stumble), and I learned to pivot when my jiggle dreams hit a wall, focusing instead on a solid conversational core.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s next for BIG BALL</p>\n<p>Next up, I\u2019m determined to crack the jiggle code\u2014maybe tweaking Spline\u2019s animation setup or switching to a GLTF export for more control. I\u2019d love to add blob variety (think colors, voices, and moods), juice up the conversational AI with more depth, and polish the audio sync. Down the line, I see BIG BALL as a mobile app or a customizable widget, bringing blob joy everywhere.</p>\n</div>",
