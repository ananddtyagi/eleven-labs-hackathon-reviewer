Plus, if someone suddenly asks a \u201chey, what was our conversion rate last week?\u201d kind of question, everyone ends up scrambling through different tabs and dashboards.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The PostHog Meeting Copilot is a friendly voice assistant that joins your meetings, automatically shares (and even summarizes) your key PostHog dashboards and insights. So, no more screen-sharing chaos or awkward silences trying to find that one data point\u2014just smooth, data-driven discussions every time.</p>\n<p>Email <code>parthgandhi@outlook.com</code> or <code>ishaan.shrivastava@gmail.com</code> if you want to try it out.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We integrated with the Posthog apis to get all insights/dashboards/embeds. We then used multiple <code>gpt-4o</code> calls to get relevant metrics, summarize them, and give a user-friendly output through the Elevenlabs voice agent.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We underestimated how hard it would be to do an arbitrary HogQL generator. </li>\n<li>Google Meet/Zoom do not have good integrations for conversational agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Along the way, we also discovered a bug in the Posthog client library: <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/1066739690436313158/1342583407607283722/1343197902738165853\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.com/channels/1066739690436313158/1342583407607283722/1343197902738165853</a></p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>It works! </li>\n<li>We actually liked the problem we were solving for and face it regularly.</li>\n<li>We learnt at least 4-5 new tools/frameworks/technologies over the weekend.</li>\n<li>We were able to effectively prune our original vision to make sure we still have a minimum-lovable-product by submission time.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>How to effectively use the Elevenlabs conversational voice agent</li>\n<li>How to use lovable, and when to directly code or use an AI tool.</li>\n<li>How to solve interesting problems with the new modalities that have emerged</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for PostHog Meeting Copilot</h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve also started working on a couple of additional features - </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Google meet and Zoom integration, so the bot can automatically join all your virtual meetings through calendar invites.</li>\n<li>An ad-hoc query generator that lets you ask arbitrary questions that are not in an existing insight.

    "critic": "Here's my critical analysis of the PostHog Meeting Copilot project, focusing on potential issues and areas of improvement:\n\nImpact (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- Limited scalability due to dependency on specific platforms (PostHog only)\n- Potential privacy concerns in sharing metrics automatically in meetings\n- May create over-reliance on automated systems for data interpretation\n- No clear monetization strategy or business model presented\n- Could potentially reduce team members' direct engagement with data analytics\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- Incomplete integration with major meeting platforms (Google Meet/Zoom)\n- Reliance on GPT-4 could lead to high operational costs\n- No mention of error handling or fallback mechanisms\n- Lack of real-time data processing capabilities\n- Security considerations for sensitive business metrics not addressed\n- HogQL generator challenges remain unresolved\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- Concept is essentially a voice interface for existing dashboard functionality\n- Similar solutions exist for general meeting assistants\n- Doesn't solve the underlying problem of data literacy\n- Limited to pre-existing dashboards and insights\n- Innovation seems incremental rather than transformative\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- Documentation lacks technical architecture details\n- No demo video or screenshots provided\n- Missing performance metrics or user testing results\n- Limited information about security and privacy considerations\n- No clear deployment or installation instructions\n- Absence of user interface examples\n\nCritical Recommendations:\n1. Need for robust security framework for handling sensitive business data\n2. Development of platform-agnostic solution\n3. Implementation of user authentication and access control\n4. Clear documentation of system limitations and error scenarios\n5. Addition of offline functionality for reliability\n6. Development of comprehensive testing strategy\n7. Creation of detailed technical documentation\n8. Implementation of data privacy controls\n9. Addition of user customization options\n10. Development of clear pricing and business model\n\nThe project shows potential but requires significant development in key areas before it could be considered production-ready or widely adoptable.",
    "judgement": "{\n    \"summary\": \"The advocate emphasizes the project's practical value in solving a common business problem, successful integration of multiple technologies, and strong potential for adoption. They highlight the team's ability to deliver a working MVP while learning new tools. The critic points out concerns about platform dependency, security/privacy issues, incomplete technical implementation, and lack of detailed documentation/testing.\",\n\n    \"analysis\": \"The project addresses a genuine business need with a novel approach, combining voice AI with data analytics. While the technical implementation shows promise through the integration of PostHog APIs, GPT-4, and ElevenLabs, there are valid concerns about security, scalability, and platform dependencies. The innovation lies more in the integration of existing technologies rather than breakthrough innovation. The presentation is clear but lacks crucial technical details and demonstration materials.\",\n\n    \"scores\": {\n        \"impact\": 7,\n        \"technical_implementation\": 6,\n        \"creativity_and_innovation\": 7,\n        \"pitch_and_presentation\": 6\n    },\n\n    \"final_verdict\": \"PostHog Meeting Copilot shows promising potential with a solid foundation addressing a real business need. To move forward, the team should prioritize: 1) Implementing robust security and privacy controls, 2) Developing platform-agnostic integration capabilities, 3) Creating comprehensive technical documentation and testing procedures, 4) Adding demonstration materials and user interface examples. The project earns a combined weighted score of 6.5/10, reflecting its strong concept but noting significant areas for improvement before production readiness.\"\n}",
