    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>About the Project</h2>\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\n<p>TimeTraveler was inspired not only by classic sci-fi movies and the timeless allure of time travel,<br/>\nbut also by the concept of <strong>anemoia</strong>\u2014that deep nostalgia for memories you never had.  </p>\n<p>I was captivated by YouTube playlists that embrace this unique sentiment,<br/>\nand by the liminal ambient music that has become a favorite among Gen-Z.  </p>\n<p>This blend of imaginative longing and evocative soundscapes sparked the idea<br/>\nof creating an app where users can step into different eras\u2014both past and future\u2014<br/>\nand experience immersive worlds paired with heartfelt, personalized conversations.</p>\n<h3>What I Learned</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>ElevenLabs Conversation AI:</strong><br/>\nI learned how to integrate and utilize ElevenLabs to generate natural, context-aware conversations.<br/>\nIt was both challenging and incredibly fun.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>fal.ai\u2019s Capabilities:</strong><br/>\nI explored how fal.ai can quickly generate immersive images and even sound elements like a ringback tone,<br/>\nenhancing the overall experience.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Deepseek for Backstories:</strong><br/>\nCombining deepseek-generated backstories with ElevenLabs\u2019 conversation AI allowed me to create<br/>\nrich, believable character narratives.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Technical Coordination:</strong><br/>\nManaging multiple AI services and ensuring they work together seamlessly taught me a lot<br/>\nabout API integration and handling asynchronous workflows.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Working with Lovable:</strong><br/>\nLearning to use the least prompt to achieve the best result. \nIdentifying the root problem myself, then communicating it to Lovable, is often the best way to fix bugs.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How I Built It</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Concept Development:</strong><br/>\nThe initial concept was centered around a phone booth where the user could time travel,<br/>\nwith the phone ringing and initiating a conversation.<br/>\nHowever, due to the longer generation time for videos, I pivoted to using fal.ai to generate<br/>\na fast, immersive image of the street as seen from a balcony in the chosen era.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Role &amp; Responsibilities:</strong><br/>\nI served as both the PM and Tech Lead, reviewing code, identifying and fixing bugs,<br/>\nand guiding the development process using Lovable.<br/>\nThis involved closely monitoring changes, ensuring code stability,<br/>\nand integrating various components like ElevenLabs, fal.ai, and deepseek.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong><br/>\nThe project leverages Lovable for coding and project management,<br/>\nReact.js for the frontend, ElevenLabs for voice synthesis and conversation,<br/>\nfal.ai for image and ringback audio generation, deepseek for generating rich backstories,<br/>\nand Supabase for the database and edge functions.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Integration Complexity:</strong><br/>\nCoordinating between multiple APIs (ElevenLabs, fal.ai, deepseek) required careful orchestration<br/>\nto maintain a seamless user experience.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Regression Bugs:</strong><br/>\nLovable\u2019s frequent code changes led to regression issues that I had to track down and fix,<br/>\nensuring that all functionalities worked as intended.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Balancing Speed and Immersion:</strong><br/>\nInitially planning for video generation, I had to adapt the concept to still images<br/>\nto meet performance needs while still delivering an immersive experience.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>This project has been a rewarding journey that melds futuristic AI technology with the imaginative world of time travel.  </p>\n<p>It not only allowed me to dive deep into cutting-edge tools like ElevenLabs and fal.ai,<br/>\nbut also provided invaluable lessons in project management and technical integration.  </p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun building and refining this app, and I hope it inspires others<br/>\nto explore the limitless possibilities at the intersection of creativity and technology.</p>\n</div>",
