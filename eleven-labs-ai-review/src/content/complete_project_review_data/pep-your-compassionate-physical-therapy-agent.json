This inspired us to create Pep \u2013 a Duolingo-style experience for physical therapy, making it fun, engaging, and easy to stay committed.</p>\n<h2>What Pep does \ud83c\udfaf</h2>\n<p>Physical therapy only works if you actually do it \u2013 but it's hard to stay motivated without instant rewards or feedback. Pep fixes this.\nHere\u2019s how Pep helps users stick to their PT exercises (not all have been implemented):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pep sends an endearing reminder at the right time.</li>\n<li>Gamification sparks motivation for each micro-exercise.</li>\n<li>One-tap start minimizes friction and makes it easy to begin.</li>\n<li>Pep\u2019s in-exercise voice offers feedback and companionship throughout.</li>\n<li>Pep proactively logs symptoms and improvements with real-time honesty.</li>\n<li>Pep celebrates your progress, showing how today\u2019s effort builds toward PT goals.</li>\n<li>Powered by AI, every interaction with Pep is fresh and personal \u2013 a compassionate companion guiding users through their PT journey.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Vision \ud83d\udd2d</h2>\n<p>While physical therapy exhibits a real need, the roadblocks to motivation and consistency are universal \u2014  loss of novelty, transactional interactions, lack of feedback, forgetfulness, loneliness, etc. AI can effectively tackle this at a fraction of the cost of carefully designing a personalized, humanistic support system by hand (like Duolingo does). Pep can extend to other things people need help executing, whether it\u2019s saving money, taking medication, making time for a hobby, or practicing better parenting.</p>\n<h3>How we built it \ud83d\udd27</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pep is a Swift iOS app.</li>\n<li>We mainly use the 11labs Conversation AI Swift SDK to create a voice UI that interacts with users, providing live coaching and feedback.</li>\n<li>We had a lot of fun customizing client tools within the 11labs SDK.</li>\n<li>We also integrated Apple\u2019s Vision Framework to detect user joints and evaluate exercise accuracy in real time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenges we ran into \ud83d\udee0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\ud83d\udd39 Memory Safety Issues in 11labs SDK\nThe Swift SDK isn't designed well in terms of memory safety.\nIncorporating it with the Vision Framework caused severe conflicts in AVFoundation, leading to crashes on iPhones during testing.</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udd39 Chaining Multiple AI Agents\nWe struggled with chaining two different AI agents to get the client tool usage correct.\nWe had to carefully manage context switching and session persistence for seamless user interactions.</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udd39 Lack of Developer Resources\nWe spent a lot of time debugging due to limited documentation and tool-use templates.\nWe hope that in the future, 11labs provides better tool-use templates to simplify AI agent chaining.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What we learned \ud83d\udcda</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How powerful conversational AI SDKs have become! \ud83e\udd2f</li>\n<li>How to integrate AI with multimodal interfaces (voice + vision).</li>\n<li>The challenges of real-time AI coaching and synchronizing AI agent transitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Team Member + Contributions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lanruo: ElevenLabs conversational AI's (client) tool use and dynamic variables </li>\n<li>Yan: vision setup, swift boilerplate, concurrency, and cute dog gif!</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
