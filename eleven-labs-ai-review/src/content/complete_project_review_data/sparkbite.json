    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve all faced moments needing a quick boost whether mastering Python or nailing a presentation. Books and long tutorials felt overwhelming, while short-form content lacked depth. Inspired by AI\u2019s power to distill wisdom into bite-sized, engaging snippets like TikTok with purpose, we envisioned SparkBite: an AI agent turning any question into a 60-second mentoring video with actionable advice and vibrant visuals. The ElevenLabs x a16z WW Hackathon lit the spark to make it real!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SparkBite delivers instant, value-packed micromentoring. Enter a prompt like \u201cHow can I learn Python,\u201d and it crafts a ~150-word, 60-second script\u2014intro, 3 practical tips, and a motivational close\u2014narrated by ElevenLabs\u2019 lifelike voice. It generates 5x scene prompts, renders 5-second video clips with fal.ai\u2019s PixVerse v3.5, and composes them into a seamless 60-second MP4 with audio. From coding to confidence, SparkBite offers daily wisdom in ~3 minutes!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>I built SparkBite solo, completely by lovable.dev\u2019s AI assistant, using a Supabase Edge Function and React frontend:\nScript: Mistral generates a ~150-word script and 5 scene prompts\u2014e.g., \u201cLaptop with Python code\u201d to \u201cCelebrating a project.\u201d\nAudio: ElevenLabs narrates the script into a 60-second clip, uploaded to Supabase Storage\u2019s media bucket.\nVideo: fal.ai\u2019s PixVerse v3.5 creates 5x 5-second clips ($0.3 each), merged with fal-ai/ffmpeg-api/compose ($1) into a 60-second video with audio.\nFrontend: src/pages/Index.tsx\u2014a simple input field triggers the function, displaying the video in a  tag.</p>\n<h2>How SparkBite Delivers Wisdom</h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a peek at SparkBite\u2019s AI-driven pipeline, turning your prompt into a 60-second mentoring video:\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/vxmyrZ42\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"graph\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/fYt6K4dm/graph.png\"/></a></p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>I started with Kling 1.6 took 6 minutes, too slow. FFmpeg wasn\u2019t available in Edge Runtime, forcing frontend sync attempts that misaligned audio. So I used fal.ai's ffmpeg-api/compose. I tried to Image-to-video workflows (under $1) lacked scene quality. But find the optimal one PixVerse v3.5. Silent errors (\"Video error: {}\") tested my patience, but persistence paid off! \nTime was my biggest foe .</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>First Hackathon: My debut, solo, from scratch. </p>\n<p>Value: ~150-word, 60-second videos. Scenes: </p>\n<p>Mistral\u2019s dynamic prompts turned raw scripts into meaningful visuals.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>I learned chaining AI models Mistral, ElevenLabs, fal.ai into a cohesive agent. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SparkBite</h2>\n<p>Platform: Evolve into a full web app for daily boosts.\nScenes: Boost quality with richer prompts or advanced models.\nInteractivity: Add chat, refine prompts live.\nCost: Push below ~$2-$3 to scale smarter.</p>\n</div>",
