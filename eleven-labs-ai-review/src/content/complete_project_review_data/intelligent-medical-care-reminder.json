    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Watching my grandmother struggle with her daily medications \u2013 forgetting doses, mixing up timings, and getting anxious about tracking her vital signs \u2013 sparked this idea. One day, she accidentally doubled her blood pressure medication, and it hit me: we needed something more reliable than occasional phone calls. If technology could make banking easier, why couldn't it help our elderly loved ones manage their health safely and independently? That's why I created this AI Medical Companion \u2013 to be the constant, caring reminder that families can't always be.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Makes automated, intelligent calls to elderly patients to remind them about medications and record vital signs at prescribed times.</strong> Collects and securely stores all health data, making it instantly accessible to family members through a mobile app.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>I used ElevenLabs for AI calling along with Twilio. I setup a server and create websocket connection with twilio and elevenlabs. <strong>When the careplan is fed in the system, it generates a series of events for medications and vital readings at fixed times throughout the day. The AI agent calls at those fixed times and interactively talks to the patient and collects information.</strong> For workflow I am using Activepieces. I am storing the call data in DynamoDB. From DyanmoDB I am pulling. a daily report. This report is fed to the app. The family members will few the daily analysis report in their app. I am using Lovable for web building. Right now the integration is not there with backend for time limitation. But the app generated data is same as the data from database (from BE).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Faced issues with Twilio, twilio suspended my account for voice calling. Had to wait a lot and later create a new account.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It is a great product which can successfully cut down the family member times by unnecessary calling their closed ones just to check whether the care plan is followed or not and to stay on top. It saves time of both the parties. <strong>Also if Elevenlabs exposes their API's for PVC, then the closed family members like sons/daughters can professionally clone their own voice and can call their elderly patients. This will create a very close connection.</strong></p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>I personally learned a lot about voice LLM's</p>\n<h2>What's next for Intelligent Medical Care Reminder</h2>\n<p>I plan to put it to production later or club with some health-tech to push this solution.</p>\n</div>",

    "critic": "Here's my critical analysis of the Intelligent Medical Care Reminder project, focusing on potential issues and areas for improvement:\n\n1. Impact (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- Limited scope focusing only on medication reminders and vital signs\n- No clear emergency response protocol for missed medications or concerning vital signs\n- Dependency on elderly patients' ability to answer phone calls and interact with technology\n- No evidence of pilot testing with actual elderly users\n- Potential privacy concerns with storing sensitive medical data\n\n2. Technical Implementation (25%)\nCritical Issues:\n- Backend integration is incomplete due to time constraints\n- Reliance on multiple third-party services (Twilio, ElevenLabs, Activepieces) creates multiple points of failure\n- Already encountered service suspension issues with Twilio\n- No mention of backup systems or failsafes\n- Security measures for medical data storage in DynamoDB not detailed\n- No mention of handling poor network connectivity scenarios\n\n3. Creativity and Innovation (25%)\nLimitations:\n- The core concept (medication reminders) is not particularly novel\n- Voice cloning feature could be problematic ethically and legally\n- No differentiation from existing medical reminder apps and systems\n- Lacks integration with medical devices or pharmacies\n- No machine learning components to adapt to patient behavior\n\n4. Pitch and Presentation (25%)\nAreas of Concern:\n- Project description is technically vague\n- No clear monetization strategy\n- Missing important technical architecture details\n- No metrics or KPIs defined for success\n- Limited information about user testing or feedback\n- No clear regulatory compliance considerations (HIPAA, etc.)\n\nMajor Red Flags:\n1. Incomplete implementation of core features\n2. Heavy dependence on third-party services\n3. Privacy and security concerns not adequately addressed\n4. Lack of differentiation from existing solutions\n5. No clear path to production deployment\n\nRecommendations for Improvement:\n1. Develop proprietary backend infrastructure\n2. Implement robust security measures\n3. Add emergency protocols\n4. Conduct extensive user testing\n5. Consider regulatory compliance requirements\n6. Develop unique features beyond basic reminders\n7. Create contingency plans for service disruptions\n\nThe project shows promise but requires significant development before it could be considered production-ready or impactful in the healthcare space.",
