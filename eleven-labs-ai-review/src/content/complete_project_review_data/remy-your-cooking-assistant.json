    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As a home cook, I'm often manically running around and trying to manage a cook, there might be a pot boiling, some prep to do, and some protein sizzling all at the same time. Then, I realise I don't have the right ingredient, or, I'm not entirely sure when somethings done or what to look for. I have to open up Google and search, filtering through pages of information - all while the sizzling and crackling is going on. Time is running out. </p>\n<p>Cooking can be complicated, and static instructions just don't cut it, especially when things go wrong. I wanted to create an assistant that makes following step-by-step instructions a bit easier, and using conversational AI to help with the quick questions, like 'what is al dente', or, 'what oil should i use instead of peanut oil'</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>R\u00e9my is an AI-powered cooking assistant that guides users through recipes with clear, step-by-step instructions. It adapts to the user\u2019s pace, answers questions about techniques and ingredients, and provides real-time suggestions if something doesn\u2019t go as expected.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>I was completely out of my depth here, I had some familiarity with elevenlabs, Make, APIs and webhooks, but as a Product Designer, building an app was out of my league. I used Cursor IDE to really do a lot of the heavy lifting, coupled with GPT. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The hardest was going in with a no-code approach. Not having deep technical understanding required me to leverage new AI tools to build the app. While it was great to be able to get a prototype running, it was frustrating at times to troubleshoot and work with AI-assisted IDEs without that technical understanding.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Honestly, even with the challenges of working with code as a 'non-dev', it was amazing to see how far these tools have come in order to get a prototype off the ground without a dev. This was the first web app I've built, so that in itself was a huge accomplishment for me, and the challenge I set out for myself.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A bunch of new tools, definitely not exposed to these sides of tech with my day-to-day, it's amazing to see how for AI powered/embedded tech has come in such a short time. I've been able to wrap my head around some new apps that I definitely want to dive further on after the hackathon.</p>\n<p>Also, if you don't have a technical teammate, definitely keep a lean scope and test endlessly while making perceived small changes.</p>\n<p>Like, while writing this I had Claude making constant code changes to try to troubleshoot why we couldn't get it working when deployed to vercel, so we changed all the timeouts and implemented polling. Thats absolutely crazy.</p>\n<h2>What's next for R\u00e9my \u2013 Your cooking assistant</h2>\n<p>If I had more time, definitely to improve some core functionality. There's some UI bugs and tweaks I'd make. I wanted to get this hands-free and use Mistral, but I didn't have the time. I knew a good amount of Elevenlabs so that definitely helped with that side of things \u2013 however, I'd like to spend more time tweaking the agent.</p>\n<p>Defintely some improvements around personalisation, nutrition and dietary substitions.</p>\n</div>",

    "critic": "Here's my critical analysis of the remy-your-cooking-assistant project:\n\nImpact (25%):\nWeaknesses:\n- Limited scalability potential without proper technical infrastructure\n- No clear monetization strategy presented\n- Lacks integration with existing cooking platforms or ecosmental tracking\n- Market is already saturated with cooking apps and AI assistants\n- No mention of data privacy considerations for user interactions\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%):\nMajor Concerns:\n- Built by a non-developer using AI tools, suggesting potential technical debt\n- Deployment issues evident (mentioned Vercel problems)\n- Heavy reliance on third-party AI tools could lead to stability issues\n- No mention of backend architecture or data management\n- Questionable robustness of the solution given the no-code approach\n- Limited technical depth in implementation\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%):\nCritical Points:\n- Core concept isn't particularly novel (voice-assisted cooking apps exist)\n- Features seem basic and standard for cooking apps\n- No truly innovative differentiators presented\n- Lacks unique selling proposition beyond voice interaction\n- Solution appears to be a combination of existing technologies rather than true innovation\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%):\nIssues:\n- Presentation focuses too much on personal journey rather than product capabilities\n- Lack of concrete metrics or user testing results\n- No clear business model or go-to-market strategy\n- Missing technical architecture details\n- Vague about future developments\n- No demonstration of actual user benefits\n\nAdditional Concerns:\n1. Project seems more like a learning exercise than a viable product\n2. Heavy dependence on AI tools suggests limited control over core functionality\n3. No mention of performance metrics or response times\n4. Absence of error handling mechanisms\n5. Limited scope of features actually implemented\n\nRecommendations for Improvement:\n1. Develop proper technical foundation instead of relying on AI-assisted development\n2. Create clear differentiation from existing solutions\n3. Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms\n4. Establish clear metrics for success\n5. Focus on unique value proposition rather than generic features\n6. Develop proper technical documentation and architecture\n7. Include actual user testing and feedback\n\nOverall, while the project shows enthusiasm, it lacks the technical depth and unique innovation required for a successful product in this space.",
    "judgement": "{\n    \"summary\": \"The advocate emphasizes the project's practical utility in solving real cooking challenges, impressive achievement for a non-developer, and innovative use of AI tools. They highlight the clear problem statement and potential for widespread adoption. The critic points out technical limitations, reliance on AI tools suggesting potential instability, lack of unique innovation, and absence of concrete metrics or business strategy.\",\n\n    \"analysis\": \"Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates admirable initiative in addressing a common problem and shows what's possible with modern AI tools. However, the technical foundation raises legitimate concerns about long-term viability. The project's strength lies in its practical application and accessibility, while its main weaknesses are in technical robustness and differentiation from existing solutions. The honest presentation of challenges and limitations is commendable, though more focus on technical architecture and concrete metrics would strengthen the pitch.\",\n\n    \"scores\": {\n        \"impact\": 7,\n        \"technical_implementation\": 4,\n        \"creativity_and_innovation\": 6,\n        \"pitch_and_presentation\": 7\n    },\n\n    \"final_verdict\": \"A promising concept with practical value, but requires significant technical strengthening to be viable long-term. Recommendations: 1) Partner with a technical co-founder to rebuild with proper architecture, 2) Conduct user testing to validate unique value proposition, 3) Develop clear differentiation from existing solutions, 4) Create concrete metrics for success, 5) Focus on one key innovative feature that sets it apart from competitors.
