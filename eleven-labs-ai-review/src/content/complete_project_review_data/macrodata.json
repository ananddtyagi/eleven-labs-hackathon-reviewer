However, we did this app in retro style just for fun.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Macrodata helps you analyze trending narratives about your brand, helping you make data-backed decisions. When you enter a brand (or any other term) into the app, it fetches the latest tweets about this topic, categorizes them by trends, and provides a short text and audio briefing about the brand. It allows you to see current prevailing narratives that you should pay attention to.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h3>Coding</h3>\n<p>Front-end: React + TypeScript\nBackend: Python</p>\n<h3>APIs:</h3>\n<p>Mistral AI Agent: Generatic topic names based on top tweets and daily briefing text\nPerplexity AI Agent: Generating tweet-looking data based on the latest news (X API is not free)\nEleventLabs Agent: Audio briefing with custom voice</p>\n<h3>Categorization:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>SentenceTransformer ('all-MiniLM-L6-v2') for semantic embeddings</li>\n<li>TF-IDF with n-grams for word pattern analysis</li>\n<li>K-means clustering for grouping similar posts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Accessing real-time data. X API is very limited, so we needed to improvise and generate fresh data using an AI agent</li>\n<li>Topic categorization is far from perfect</li>\n<li>Categorization takes too much time</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>It works and shows real data</li>\n<li>Design</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Learned a little Python</li>\n<li>Learned that AI is not good at summarising large amounts of data</li>\n<li>Working with friends is super fun</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for Macrodata</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Igor wants to work on the challenges we encountered </li>\n<li>Add sentiment analysis and more insights</li>\n<li>Igor wants to build a company around it</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>Deployment is not really working.

    "critic": "Let me provide a critical analysis of the Macrodata project based on the judging rubric:\n\nImpact (25%)\nWeaknesses:\n- The project's scalability is severely limited by its reliance on generated data rather than real Twitter/X data\n- No clear monetization strategy or business model presented\n- The target market and specific use cases aren't well defined\n- The deployment issues severely limit immediate real-world impact\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%)\nCritical Issues:\n- Performance problems with categorization taking too long\n- Admitted issues with topic categorization accuracy\n- Deployment failures indicate incomplete technical execution\n- Heavy reliance on AI-generated fake data rather than real social media data\n- No mention of error handling or edge cases\n- Architecture seems basic without consideration for scaling\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%)\nLimitations:\n- The core concept (social media sentiment analysis) isn't particularly novel\n- The retro styling appears to be purely aesthetic without functional purpose\n- Limited feature set compared to existing social media analytics tools\n- No truly innovative approaches to solving the fundamental challenges\n- Seems more like a proof of concept than a innovative solution\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%)\nAreas of Concern:\n- Project presentation lacks professional polish\n- No clear metrics or KPIs for success\n- Missing competitive analysis\n- No demonstration of actual results or effectiveness\n- Future plans are vague and personality-dependent (\"Igor wants to...\")\n- Accomplishments section is notably thin\n\nMajor Red Flags:\n1. Non-functional deployment\n2. Reliance on fake data\n3. Performance issues\n4. Limited technical sophistication\n5. Incomplete implementation of core features\n\nSummary:\nWhile the project shows some potential as a concept, its current state has significant shortcomings across all evaluation criteria. The technical implementation is particularly concerning with multiple fundamental issues. The project appears to be more of a hackathon prototype than a viable product, with serious questions about its readiness for real-world application.\n\nOverall Score Estimate: Below Average\nThe project would need substantial improvements in all areas to be competitive, particularly in technical implementation and real-world viability.",
    "judgement": "{\n    \"summary\": \"The Advocate emphasizes the project's business potential, sophisticated technical integration, and creative approach to brand monitoring. They highlight the thoughtful implementation of multiple AI technologies and praise the honest presentation. The Critic points out significant technical limitations, reliance on fake data, deployment issues, and questions the project's readiness for real-world application.\",\n    \n    \"analysis\": \"Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates innovative thinking and potential value for brand monitoring, but faces serious technical hurdles. The combination of AI technologies shows technical ambition, but implementation issues and performance problems indicate execution challenges. The honest presentation style is commendable, though the lack of deployment and reliance on generated data are significant concerns. The retro design adds character but may not add functional value.\",\n    \n    \"scores\": {\n        \"impact\": 6,\n        \"technical_implementation\": 4,\n        \"creativity_and_innovation\": 7,\n        \"pitch_and_presentation\": 6\n    },\n    \n    \"final_verdict\": \"Macrodata shows promise as a concept but requires substantial technical improvements to be viable. Recommendations: 1) Resolve deployment issues and implement real social media data integration, 2) Optimize categorization performance, 3) Develop clear metrics for success and competitive analysis, 4) Create a detailed business model and monetization strategy. The project scores 5.75/10 overall, showing potential but needing significant development to become a production-ready solution. The team's honest approach and creative vision provide a good foundation for future improvements.\"\n}",
