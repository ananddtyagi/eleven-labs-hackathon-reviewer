    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the idea of building something that felt dynamic and a little chaotic.  The concept of putting Agents in a virtual space, equipping them with tools, and giving them general direction seemed like a fun concept.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This project allows you to join what is effectively a dynamic virtual meeting.  The agents then autonomously determine which other \"expert agents\" are needed to address the user's stated problem. Communication is primarily voice-based, but you can also request agents to provide forms for file uploads or text input. Agents have access to search, a virtual file system, and other tools. Once they understand your goal, they will work towards it, sometimes in a somewhat chaotic and disorganized manner \u2013 much like a human team might.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prompt engineering was challenging, particularly in striking the right balance in agent recruitment to avoid adding too many or too few.</li>\n<li>The voice handoff between agents was technically challenging and remains an area for improvement.  Specifically, during transitions between agents, there is a risk of losing user input if no agent is actively connected at that precise moment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We successfully built a fairly complex system for agent interaction, incorporating a range of useful tools, all developed from scratch.</li>\n<li>We are particularly proud of moments when the agent handoff works smoothly, resulting in agents effectively collaborating and performing significant work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensuring agents reliably utilize the appropriate tools in different situations remains a key challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for RoundTable</h2>\n<p>Not sure yet :)</p>\n</div>",

    "critic": "Here's my critical analysis of the RoundTable project based on the judging rubric:\n\nImpact (25%):\n- Major Concerns:\n  * No clear target market or specific problem being solved\n  * Lacks a defined business model or path to monetization\n  * Project's future direction is undefined (\"Not sure yet :)\")\n  * Question marks around practical real-world applications vs being just an interesting tech demo\n  * No discussion of scalability considerations\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%):\n- Significant Issues:\n  * Acknowledged problems with voice handoff between agents\n  * Risk of losing user input during agent transitions\n  * Unreliable tool usage by agents\n  * No mention of performance metrics or testing\n  * Technical architecture and infrastructure details are vague\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%):\n- Limitations:\n  * The concept of AI agents collaborating isn't particularly novel\n  * Seems more like an implementation of existing ideas rather than true innovation\n  * The \"chaotic and disorganized\" nature could be a liability rather than a feature\n  * No clear differentiation from other AI assistant platforms\n  * Limited creative solution to actual user problems\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%):\n- Weaknesses:\n  * Presentation lacks concrete examples or use cases\n  * No demonstration of actual impact or results\n  * Missing metrics or success indicators\n  * Vague about technical capabilities\n  * Poor articulation of value proposition\n  * Informal and incomplete project roadmap\n\nAdditional Critical Points:\n1. The project seems more focused on technical experimentation than solving real user needs\n2. Lack of attention to user experience, especially given the acknowledged chaos in interactions\n3. No discussion of privacy, security, or ethical considerations\n4. Missing information about performance optimization and resource utilization\n5. Absence of competitive analysis or market positioning\n\nRecommendation:\nThe project needs significant refinement in its purpose, implementation, and presentation. Currently, it appears more as a proof-of-concept rather than a viable product. The team should focus on defining clear use cases, improving technical reliability, and developing a concrete roadmap for future development.\n\nOverall Assessment:\nWhile technically interesting, the project falls short in multiple crucial areas and requires substantial work to become a compelling solution.",
