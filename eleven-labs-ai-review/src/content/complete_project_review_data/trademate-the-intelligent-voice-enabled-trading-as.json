    "project_details": "<div>\n<h1>TradeMate \u2013 The Intelligent Voice-Enabled Trading Assistant</h1>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>TradeMate is a AI Agent designed to assist traders\u2014whether beginners or experienced\u2014by combining real-time market analysis, customizable voice notifications, an interactive AI chat, and a functional simulated trading system.  </p>\n<p>Developed solo for the ElevenLabs x a16z Hackathon, this project leverages <strong>Next.js with TypeScript</strong> for a high-performance interface, the <strong>Binance API</strong> for market data, <strong>OpenAI</strong> for AI logic, and <strong>ElevenLabs</strong> for realistic voice outputs in English and French.  </p>\n<p>TradeMate delivers an immersive, accessible experience, perfect for busy or mobile traders.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<h3>1. Real-Time Market Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>TradeMate displays an <strong>interactive Bitcoin (BTC) chart</strong> in real-time, powered by the Binance API.<br/></li>\n<li>Key information includes:\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Current price</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1-hour price variation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Trading volume</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Data is dynamically updated to reflect market fluctuations, providing users with a clear and accurate overview.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Intelligent Voice Notifications with ElevenLabs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>realistic AI-generated voice</strong> informs users at customizable intervals (e.g., every 5, 10, or 15 minutes) about market conditions.</li>\n<li>Voice notifications include:\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Current BTC price</strong><br/></li>\n<li><strong>1-hour variation</strong> (e.g., <em>\u201cThe price of Bitcoin is $50,000, with a +2.5% variation over 1 hour\u201d</em>).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Users can <strong>select from multiple voice models</strong> (e.g., Alice, Bill, Aria) and <strong>two languages</strong> (English/French).<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Automatic voice mode</strong> can be toggled on/off via the interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Interactive AI Chat with OpenAI</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>An <strong>integrated chat</strong>, powered by OpenAI, allows users to ask questions about finance, the market, or trading strategies.<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Example: <em>\u201cWhat\u2019s the best time to buy Bitcoin?\u201d</em> \u2192 AI provides insights.<br/></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Chat responses can also be <strong>enhanced with voice notifications</strong> from ElevenLabs.<br/></li>\n<li>Future improvements could expand this feature for more complex interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Functional Simulated Trading with AI</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>TradeMate includes a <strong>simulated trading system</strong>, where OpenAI\u2019s AI:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Analyzes market data<br/></li>\n<li>Applies <strong>fictional positions</strong> (e.g., buying or selling BTC) based on simple rules (<em>e.g., buy if the 1-hour variation exceeds +2%</em>).<br/></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Users can see a <strong>simulated balance updated in real-time</strong>, with voice confirmation from ElevenLabs (e.g., <em>\u201cPosition opened: Bought Bitcoin at $50,000\u201d</em>).<br/></li>\n<li>This system is <strong>purely educational</strong> and does not handle real money but <strong>faithfully simulates automated trading</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5. Modern User Interface with Next.js and TypeScript</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Built with <strong>Next.js</strong> for optimal performance and <strong>TypeScript</strong> for robustness.</li>\n<li>Features:\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interactive chart</strong> (using Lightweight charts) visualizing BTC trends.</li>\n<li><strong>Buttons &amp; menus</strong> for settings (e.g., voice, chat, simulated trading).</li>\n<li><strong>Smooth, responsive, and visually appealing</strong> user interface.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Technologies Used</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: Next.js, TypeScript, React, CSS (or another styling library for a modern design).<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Market Data</strong>: Binance API for real-time BTC data (price, variation, volume).<br/></li>\n<li><strong>AI</strong>: OpenAI for analysis logic and the interactive chat.<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Voice</strong>: ElevenLabs for realistic, multilingual voice notifications in English and French, with multiple voice models (Mark, Alice, Aria) and customization options.<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Hosted on <strong>Vercel</strong> for immediate accessibility \u2192 <a href=\"https://hackathon-trademate.vercel.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hackathon-trademate.vercel.app/</a><br/></li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Challenge and Innovation</h2>\n<p>As a solo developer and beginner, I took on the challenge of designing, coding, and deploying a <strong>fully functional AI Agent in 39 hours</strong> for this hackathon.  </p>\n<h3>Why TradeMate Stands Out:</h3>\n<p>\u2705 <strong>Democratizes trading</strong> by making complex data accessible through <strong>simple voice and interface solutions</strong>, ideal for novice or mobile traders.<br/>\n\u2705 Leverages <strong>hackathon partners\u2019 tools</strong> (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Binance) to create a <strong>multimodal experience</strong> (visual, textual, vocal).<br/>\n\u2705 <strong>Solo project</strong> demonstrating skills in <strong>Next.js, TypeScript, AI, and API integration</strong> under time constraints.  </p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Potential Business Plan</h2>\n<h3>Vision</h3>\n<p>TradeMate could evolve into a <strong>fintech startup</strong> or <strong>commercial application</strong> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Individual traders</strong> (beginners &amp;
