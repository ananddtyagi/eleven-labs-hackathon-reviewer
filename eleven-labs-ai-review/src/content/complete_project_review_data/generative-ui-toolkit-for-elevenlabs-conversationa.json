    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This package equips ElevenLab's Conversational AI agent with tools to dynamically generate forms. When collecting precise information that\u2019s hard to share by voice, the agent can spontaneously display a form with one or multiple input fields alongside the widget. The user can fill the form or even collaborate with the agent using their voice.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We created this library as an extension to the ElevenLabs Conversational AI Widget. It\u2019s a single JavaScript file hosted on a CDN that can be added to any HTML page via a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. It uses no external vendors or backend. The script provides the necessary client tool implementations, while the reusable system prompt and tool descriptions (available in the GitHub repo) guide the agent on how to use them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Created a powerful, fully functional open-source tool that eliminates friction in using voice interfaces facilitating their wider adoption.</li>\n<li>None of us had experience with conversational AI or voice agents before the hackathon, so building and publishing a working product in just two days is an accomplishment in itself.</li>\n<li>Despite a limited time-zone overlap, we collaborated effectively and delivered quickly, even though it was our first hackathon as a team.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Creating a comprehensive yet concise demo.<br/></li>\n<li>Lack of a CLI or IaC tool for agent configuration (requiring us to build our own script).<br/></li>\n<li>The agent tends to provide excessive information, despite instructions to be as concise as possible.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Future development</h2>\n<p>Future development will be guided by community feedback. If there is interest, the project will continue to evolve based on the needs and insights shared by the community. If ElevenLabs sees potential in such hybrid interfaces, this functionality could become part of the standard widget distribution.</p>\n<h2>Team</h2>\n<h3>Vlad Severin</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Brainstorming ideas.</li>\n<li>Solution technical design.</li>\n<li>Research use cases for the demo.</li>\n<li>Solution implementation.</li>\n<li>Project overview.</li>\n<li>Devtools implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bohdan Petryshyn</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Brainstorming ideas.</li>\n<li>Solution technical design.</li>\n<li>Research use cases for the demo.</li>\n<li>Solution implementation.</li>\n<li>Demo (preparations and recording).</li>\n<li>Hosting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Yevhenii Medviediev</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Brainstorming ideas.</li>\n<li>Solution technical design.</li>\n<li>Research use cases for the demo.</li>\n<li>Solution implementation.</li>\n<li>Technical documentation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Compliance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The solution idea was brainstormed, designed, and implemented from scratch during the hackathon.</li>\n<li>No dependencies or paid solutions were used.</li>\n<li>A three-member team across three different time zones (Ukraine, Poland, Indonesia) worked on the project.

The solution's simplicity and effectiveness make it highly valuable for real-world applications.\n\nThe project scores highly across all evaluation criteria, with particularly strong showings in technical implementation and innovation. Its potential for impact on voice interface adoption and usability is significant, making it a standout submission for the ElevenLabs Hackathon.",
    "critic": "Here's my critical analysis of the project based on the judging rubric:\n\nImpact (25%):\n- Major Weaknesses:\n  * The project's success heavily depends on community adoption and feedback, showing uncertainty in its long-term viability\n  * Limited scope - only focuses on form generation, which may not be enough to justify integration\n  * No clear monetization strategy or business model presented\n  * Lacks concrete metrics or data on how this actually improves user experience\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%):\n- Concerning Areas:\n  * Reliance on a single JavaScript file could lead to maintenance and scalability issues\n  * No backend integration limits functionality and data persistence capabilities\n  * Security concerns with client-side only implementation\n  * Absence of error handling and edge case management details\n  * No mention of performance optimization or load testing\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%):\n- Critical Points:\n  * The core concept (form generation) is relatively basic and not particularly groundbreaking\n  * Lacks differentiation from existing form builders and UI generators\n  * Missing integration with other popular tools or platforms\n  * Limited innovation in terms of user interaction patterns\n  * No novel approaches to solving the voice-to-text interface challenges\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%):\n- Deficiencies:\n  * Project description is too generic and lacks specific technical details\n  * Missing demonstration videos or screenshots\n  * No clear metrics or benchmarks for success\n  * Challenges section is superficial and doesn't address fundamental technical hurdles\n  * Future development section is vague and entirely dependent on community interest\n\nOverall Concerns:\n1. The project seems more like a proof-of-concept rather than a production-ready solution\n2. Heavy reliance on ElevenLabs' existing infrastructure without significant value addition\n3. Limited scope and functionality may restrict widespread adoption\n4. Lack of comprehensive testing and security considerations\n5. No clear roadmap for future development beyond community feedback\n\nRecommendations for Improvement:\n1. Develop a more robust technical architecture with backend integration\n2. Add concrete usage metrics and performance benchmarks\n3. Expand functionality beyond basic form generation\n4. Create a detailed security and privacy framework\n5. Establish clear success criteria and development milestones\n6. Include more innovative features to differentiate from existing solutions",
    "judgement": "{\n    \"summary\": \"The advocate emphasizes the project's innovative approach to combining voice and form interfaces, lightweight technical implementation, rapid development timeline, and potential for widespread impact. The critic highlights concerns about limited scope, dependency on community adoption, basic functionality, security considerations, and lack of concrete metrics or detailed technical specifications.\",\n    \n    \"analysis\": \"Both perspectives have merit. The project demonstrates a clever solution to a real problem in voice interfaces and impresses with its rapid development and minimal technical footprint. However, the critic raises valid concerns about long-term viability, security, and limited scope. The project's strength lies in its immediate utility and integration potential, while its weaknesses center on technical depth and future sustainability. The team's achievement in delivering a working solution in two days is noteworthy, though the bare-bones approach could limit scalability.\",\n    \n    \"scores\": {\n        \"impact\": 7,\n        \"technical_implementation\": 6,\n        \"creativity_and_innovation\": 8,\n        \"pitch_and_presentation\": 7\n    },\n    \n    \"final_verdict\": \"The project scores 7/10 overall, showing strong potential with room for improvement. The innovative approach to combining voice and form interfaces addresses a genuine need, and the lightweight implementation is praiseworthy. However, to reach its full potential, the team should: 1) Develop a more robust technical architecture including security measures and error handling, 2) Create concrete metrics for measuring success and user impact, 3) Expand functionality beyond basic form generation, 4) Establish a clear roadmap for future development independent of community feedback. Despite its current limitations, the project shows promise as a valuable addition to the ElevenLabs ecosystem, particularly if the recommended improvements are implemented.\"\n}",
