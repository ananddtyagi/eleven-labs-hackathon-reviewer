    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The project was inspired by a real-world problem faced by doctors in Poland and beyond. Surgeons and medical teams should be fully focused on their patients, but current surgical workflows require them to track medications, procedures, and complications while operating, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. Recognizing this gap, we set out to build an AI-powered assistant to streamline surgical documentation and improve patient safety.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MediceusAI is an AI-powered surgical assistant that listens, documents, and organizes every critical moment of surgery in real time. It:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digitalizes medical documentation \u2013 Converts paper-based records into digital format.</li>\n<li>Monitors narcotic drug usage \u2013 Tracks the administration of controlled substances like fentanyl.</li>\n<li>Ensures strict authorization control \u2013 Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive medical data.</li>\n<li>Eliminates manual note-taking \u2013 Allows medical personnel to focus entirely on the patient.</li>\n<li>Captures and documents surgical actions, medications, and procedures in real-time.</li>\n<li>Generates structured post-surgery reports with key events.</li>\n<li>Organizes patient records and operating room data for seamless hospital workflow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/Krzychu-Z/mediceus-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Krzychu-Z/mediceus-ai</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ElevenLabs \u2013 Conversational AI for real-time voice interaction.</li>\n<li>Next.js \u2013 Frontend framework for the user dashboard.</li>\n<li>Python Flask \u2013 Backend for AI processing and API integrations.</li>\n<li>Vercel \u2013 Web page template generation.</li>\n<li>SQLite \u2013 Database for operations and events storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Handling real-time voice processing \u2013 Ensuring low-latency transcription with high accuracy in a noisy operating room environment.</li>\n<li>Speaker diarization \u2013 Differentiating between multiple voices (surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists) remains a technical challenge, to be done in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2705 Successfully built an AI-powered real-time transcription system tailored for surgical environments.</li>\n<li>\u2705 Received interest from a hospital in Poland, validating the real-world demand for our solution.</li>\n<li>\u2705 Developed a structured post-surgery report feature, making medical documentation seamless.</li>\n<li>\u2705 Integrated a narcotic drug tracking system, enhancing medication safety and compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\ud83d\udd39 The complexity of hospital procurement cycles \u2013 Hospitals have long sales cycles and require extensive regulatory approvals.</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udd39 The importance of real-world validation \u2013 Conversations with doctors provided key insights into workflow pain points and feature prioritization.</li>\n<li>\ud83d\udd39 Optimizing AI for high-noise environments \u2013 Real-time voice processing in surgical settings requires advanced noise cancellation and robust diarization models.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for MediceusAI</h2>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 Upcoming Features &amp; Expansion Plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voice Diarization \u2013 Accurately distinguish between multiple speakers.</li>\n<li>EHR Integration \u2013 Seamless connection with hospital electronic health record systems.</li>\n<li>AI-Powered Data Insights \u2013 Provide advanced analytics on surgical performance.</li>\n<li>Hardware Partnerships \u2013 Collaborate with AI-powered microphones &amp; OR devices.</li>\n<li>Warehouse of Narcotic Drugs \u2013 Integration with hospital-controlled substance tracking systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udcc8 Business &amp; Growth Strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expand first to private hospitals and clinics before onboarding larger healthcare institutions.</li>\n<li>Develop a production-grade solution in collaboration with an interested hospital.</li>\n<li>Secure investment (~1.5M PLN) to bring the MVP to market in 6 months.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
