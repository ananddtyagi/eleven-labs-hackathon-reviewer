    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>While preparing for the hackathon, we encountered Alexis, the ElevenLabs AI agent embedded in their documentation website. After interacting with it, we saw opportunities for improvement.</p>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s face it! Conversational AIs often produce inaccurate or misleading responses. This leads to low user trust in their answers.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Mark is similar to Alexis. He answers to questions about the ElevenLabs documentation. However, he supports his verbal responses with visual proof. He scrolls through the webpage of the documentation and highlights relevant content that directly addresses your questions.</p>\n<h3>Value Proposition</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Build user trust in AI-generated responses.</li>\n<li>Save time and minimize effort needed to navigate documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>We equipped Mark with a client-side tool that highlights text on the active page. The page\u2019s HTML content is passed to Mark\u2019s system prompt via dynamic variables, enabling him to analyze the article and generate human-like responses.</p>\n<p>We integrated three ElevenLabs documentation articles into our Next.js application, embedded Mark through the ElevenLabs widget (<code>&lt;elevenlabs-convai&gt;</code>), and implemented client-side tools using TypeScript. </p>\n<p>We deployed the app using Vercel, set up analytics using PostHog, and used ElevenLabs Sound Effects to spice up our video demonstration.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>We attempted to give Mark a feature that redirects users to another URL if the answer isn\u2019t in the currently viewed article. However, the ElevenLabs AI agent widget has a limitation: its dynamic variables cannot be modified during runtime. Changing them mid-conversation causes the connection to drop.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>Despite challenges, Mark successfully delivers AI-driven document exploration, pioneering a new UX paradigm.</p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\n<p>The ElevenLabs Conversational AI framework offers vast potential across various use cases.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mark.ai</h2>\n<p>Mark has potential for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>long-term success</strong>, since he can be implemented in any text-heavy environment (e.g., API documentation, legal texts, academic research, technical manuals, textbooks);</li>\n<li><strong>scalability</strong>, since he can scale to thousands of pages efficiently using embedding-based retrieval;</li>\n<li><strong>societal impact</strong>, since he reduces cognitive load associated with navigating documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mark is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>unique</strong>, since existing AI agents either return links to sources or answer questions without references;</li>\n<li><strong>innovative</strong>, since he uses a modern cross-browser API called text fragments;</li>\n<li><strong>creative</strong>, since he enables building user trust in AI-generated responses using an unconventional approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Team &amp; Contributions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Wojciech Mroczy\u0144ski (prompt engineering, backend development)</li>\n<li>Marko Golovko (full stack development)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Compliance</h2>\n<p>We adhere to hackathon rules and deadlines.</p>\n</div>",

    "critic": "Here's my critical analysis of mark-ai based on the judging rubric:\n\nImpact (25%):\n- Limited immediate market potential as it's currently restricted to documentation use cases\n- Heavy dependency on ElevenLabs platform creates vendor lock-in\n- The solution doesn't address fundamental trust issues with AI, just provides visual references\n- Claims of reducing cognitive load are unsubstantiated without user studies\n- No clear monetization strategy or business model presented\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%):\n- Failed to implement cross-article navigation due to platform limitations\n- Appears to be a relatively simple implementation using existing ElevenLabs widgets\n- No mention of error handling or edge cases\n- Limited to client-side functionality, raising questions about scalability\n- Lacks sophisticated features like semantic search or context awareness\n- No mention of performance optimization or handling large documentation sets\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%):\n- The core concept is essentially an enhancement of existing documentation search\n- Text highlighting is not a novel feature; many documentation systems already have this\n- The \"unconventional approach\" to building trust is merely showing source text\n- No truly innovative technological breakthroughs\n- Relies heavily on existing technologies and APIs\n- Limited creative solution to the trust problem in AI\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%):\n- Project description is verbose and could be more concise\n- Lacks concrete metrics or data to support claims\n- No demonstration of actual user testing or feedback\n- Overemphasis on potential rather than actual achievements\n- Missing clear technical architecture diagrams\n- No competitive analysis or market positioning\n- Claims about uniqueness are not well-substantiated\n\nMajor Areas for Improvement:\n1. Develop a more robust technical solution that isn't constrained by platform limitations\n2. Implement actual trust-building mechanisms beyond simple text highlighting\n3. Provide quantitative data to support claims about cognitive load reduction\n4. Demonstrate real-world use cases beyond documentation\n5. Address scalability and performance concerns\n6. Include user testing results and feedback\n7. Develop a clear business model and monetization strategy\n8. Create more sophisticated features to differentiate from existing solutions\n\nThe project shows potential but currently appears to be a relatively basic implementation with significant limitations and unproven claims about its impact and effectiveness.",
    "judgement": "{\n    \"summary\": \"The advocate emphasizes Mark.ai's innovative approach to building AI trust through visual verification, broad applicability across domains, and solid technical implementation using modern technologies.
