It teaches basic math and geometry in a fun way. We created this project to help parents provide educational and entertainment content to their kids to get them to love math.</p>\n<h2>What inspired us</h2>\n<p>As educators we saw the need to merge education and entertainment through technology and to reach Latin American communities in peripheral areas with limited educational opportunities. The idea was to create a tool that allows kids to learn through short conversations and for parents to find interactive and personalized lessons.</p>\n<h2>How we built it:</h2>\n<p>Service Integration: We learned how to use Supabase, Make and Perplexity to manage authentication, workflow automation and content generation and curation. Interaction Design: We designed a simple and straightforward experience for both kids and parents. How we built the project Virtual Assistant </p>\n<h2>Design:</h2>\n<p>We built MateAventuras as an interactive tutor that guides users from different social backgrounds across Latin America to learn math and geometry. </p>\n<h3>Content Search and Selection:</h3>\n<p>We implemented a system that uses webhooks to search and display the best educational YouTube videos based on the topic requested. </p>\n<h3>Workflow Automation:</h3>\n<p>We used Make to manage real-time updates and queries to the Supabase database. User-Friendly ###Interface: \nWe designed a simple interface so parents and kids can interact without complications. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we faced:</h2>\n<p>-Configuring Row-Level Security policies in Supabase to update data securely. Data Formatting:\n-Converting JSON arrays to PostgreSQL array literals to avoid formatting errors. \n-Coordinating multiple APIs and services to offer a unified experience. \n-Designing prompts that are accurate, friendly and for both kids and parents. </p>\n<p>Despite the challenges we faced we were able to learn and experiment with new technologies and prove that learning can be an adventure for everyone.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments we\u2019re proud of:</h2>\n<p>We achieved a very natural and pleasant interaction, with an agent that can guide parents on the relevance of the topics, offer different approaches to math and curate content from the internet.And we are looking forward to bring an educational tool to Spanish speaking communities with limited access to education to expand their knowledge and have a smooth and fun interaction with a virtual tutor.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s next for <em>\"MateAventuras\"</em></h2>\n<p>In future versions of MateAventuras we will be able to generate videos autonomously and provide explanations with graphics so kids can interact with geometry concepts on screen to reinforce their learning.</p>\n</div>",

    "critic": "As a negative critic, I'll analyze this project according to the provided rubric, focusing on areas of concern and potential weaknesses:\n\nImpact (25%):\n- Limited target demographic (only Spanish-speaking children 4-6 years old) restricts broader market potential\n- Dependency on existing content (YouTube videos) rather than original material raises questions about unique value proposition\n- No clear monetization strategy or sustainability plan mentioned\n- Lacks concrete evidence or metrics of educational effectiveness\n\nTechnical Implementation (25%):\n- Heavy reliance on third-party services (Supabase, Make, Perplexity) creates multiple potential points of failure\n- Security concerns with Row-Level Security issues mentioned in challenges\n- Data formatting problems indicate potential scalability issues\n- No mention of performance metrics or system reliability measures\n- Unclear how the system handles offline scenarios or poor internet connectivity, crucial for peripheral areas\n\nCreativity and Innovation (25%):\n- The concept of educational math games is not particularly novel\n- Appears to be primarily a content aggregator rather than offering truly innovative features\n- Limited interactivity - mainly focuses on video content delivery\n- No unique technological breakthrough or innovative approach to learning\n- Similar solutions already exist in the market\n\nPitch and Presentation (25%):\n- Project description is vague about specific features and functionalities\n- Lacks concrete examples of user interactions\n- No demonstration of actual implementation or screenshots\n- Missing specific metrics or success criteria\n- Future plans are ambiguous and lack specific timelines or development roadmap\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. Over-reliance on external services could make the system unstable\n2. No clear differentiation from existing educational platforms\n3. Technical challenges mentioned suggest fundamental implementation issues\n4. Absence of concrete evidence of educational effectiveness\n5. Limited scope may hinder long-term viability\n\nAreas Needing Improvement:\n1. Develop original content rather than depending on YouTube\n2. Implement robust offline capabilities for target communities\n3. Create more interactive features beyond video watching\n4. Establish clear metrics for measuring learning outcomes\n5. Develop a concrete business model for sustainability\n\nThe project, while well-intentioned, appears to lack the technical robustness and innovative features necessary to make a significant impact in educational technology. Its current form seems more like a proof of concept than a fully realized educational solution.",
    "judgement": "{\n    \"summary\": \"The advocate emphasizes MateAventuras' potential social impact in Latin American education, strong technical integration, and innovative approach to making math engaging for young children. They highlight the dual-user focus and scalability potential. The critic points out concerns about over-reliance on third-party services, limited originality, lack of concrete metrics, and potential sustainability issues.\",\n    \n    \"analysis\": \"Both perspectives raise valid points. The project addresses a genuine need in Spanish-speaking communities and shows thoughtful implementation. However, technical dependencies and lack of original content are legitimate concerns. The focus on a specific age group and language could be both a strength (targeted solution) and limitation (restricted market). While the technical implementation shows promise, the reliance on external services and mentioned security challenges suggest some fundamental issues to address.\",\n    \n    \"scores\": {\n        \"impact\": 8,\n        \"technical_implementation\": 6,\n        \"creativity_and_innovation\": 7,\n        \"pitch_and_presentation\": 7\n    },\n    \n    \"final_verdict\": \"MateAventuras shows strong potential with a score of 7/10 overall. Its focus on educational accessibility and thoughtful implementation are commendable, though there are areas needing improvement. Recommendations: 1) Develop more original content to reduce dependency on third-party sources, 2) Implement robust offline capabilities for target communities with limited internet access, 3) Create clear metrics for measuring educational impact, 4) Strengthen technical infrastructure to reduce dependency risks, 5) Develop a clear sustainability plan. The project has strong foundations but needs these improvements to achieve its full potential.\"\n}",
