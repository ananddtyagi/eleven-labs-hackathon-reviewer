    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>AI assistants are used by salespeople, teachers, pastors, therapists, consultants, and more, but they always feel all or nothing\u2014either the AI takes full control, or the user has to micromanage every detail. There\u2019s no middle ground where AI can think ahead while remaining adaptable.</p>\n<p>Thinking ahead while talking is hard\u2014whether you\u2019re a teacher guiding a discussion, a doctor explaining options to a patient, or a consultant steering a meeting. AI should help, but most systems either force rigid automation or demand constant manual input. We wanted a solution where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI plans ahead dynamically but lets users override and steer when needed.</li>\n<li>AI\u2019s thought process is visible instead of hidden inside a black-box model.</li>\n<li>The interface feels intuitive and real-time, without requiring perfect prompts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>Greenroom is a real-time, visual AI conversation control system. Instead of just responding to input, the AI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plans ahead based on the conversation flow.</li>\n<li>Visualizes its own thought process on a whiteboard (tldraw).</li>\n<li>Lets the user intervene\u2014adjusting tone, context, and direction on the fly.</li>\n<li>Updates dynamically when users make changes, adapting in real-time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, if a therapist is guiding a session, they can see the AI\u2019s planned direction and adjust if the conversation needs a different tone. If a salesperson realizes the client needs a new approach, they can steer the AI\u2019s strategy mid-call. The AI doesn\u2019t just react\u2014it actively co-directs the conversation while remaining flexible.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind</li>\n<li>Backend: Bun.</li>\n<li>AI &amp; Voice Systems:\n\n<ul>\n<li>OpenAI GPT models for conversation planning and response generation.</li>\n<li>ElevenLabs API for real-time voice synthesis.</li>\n<li>WebSockets for smooth, lag-free media streaming.</li>\n<li>Web Speech API for live speech recognition.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Whiteboard Logic:\n    - We love tldraw!!!\n\n<ul>\n<li>AI-generated \u201cthought nodes\u201d show conversation direction.</li>\n<li>Users can adjust tone, context, and structure dynamically.</li>\n<li>The AI updates its strategy in response to changes.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li> Keeping AI flexible without making it unpredictable\u2014it needs to plan ahead but stay responsive when the user intervenes.</li>\n<li> Real-time synchronization\u2014AI updates, voice output, and whiteboard visuals all needed to stay in sync without lag.</li>\n<li> Designing an intuitive UI\u2014people don\u2019t naturally think in prompts, so we had to make sure the canvas felt effortless to use.</li>\n<li> Managing AI-generated pacing\u2014AI needed to anticipate conversation flow without forcing rigid structure.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We\u2019re Proud Of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual AI control system\u2014we moved beyond text prompts into spatial, interactive control.</li>\n<li>Seamless real-time updates\u2014AI adjusts its responses and thought process instantly when the user makes a change.</li>\n<li>Fluid integration of speech, text, and visual planning\u2014all conversation elements work together naturally.</li>\n<li>Balance between automation and control\u2014AI directs, but users always have visibility and intervention power.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Real-time AI planning is hard\u2014it needs to think ahead without overcommitting to a single path.</li>\n<li>Users don\u2019t just want control\u2014they want visibility. Even if they don\u2019t intervene, seeing the AI\u2019s plan builds trust and understanding.</li>\n<li>Text-based prompting has limits\u2014a whiteboard approach makes AI adjustments much more intuitive.</li>\n<li>Tone and pacing matter more than expected\u2014people don\u2019t just want the right response, they want the right delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What\u2019s Next for Greenroom</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrating more knowledge sources\u2014allowing users to bring in external docs, research, and structured data.</li>\n<li>More granular AI steering\u2014expanding how users can guide tone, pacing, and structure.</li>\n<li>Collaborative mode\u2014multiple users being able to co-direct a conversation in a team setting.</li>\n<li>Expanding AI personas\u2014letting users train the AI on specific conversational styles.</li>\n<li>Beyond conversations\u2014exploring applications in scriptwriting, guided learning, and AI-assisted interviews.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Greenroom isn\u2019t just about fixing AI assistants\u2014it\u2019s about rethinking how we interact with AI in real-time.</p>\n</div>",
