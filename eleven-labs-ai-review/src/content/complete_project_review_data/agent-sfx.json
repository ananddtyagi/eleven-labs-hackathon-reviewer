    "project_details": "<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We are game developers, and we know how challenging game development can be. Sound design often becomes an afterthought due to time and budget constraints.  </p>\n<p>Scouring sound effects and recording voiceovers is <strong>time-consuming and expensive</strong>, whether you're an indie dev or a AAA studio. We saw an opportunity to <strong>save time and costs</strong> while making high-quality audio <strong>more accessible</strong> to all developers.  </p>\n<p>Agent SFX allows game creators to generate <strong>professional voiceovers and sound effects instantly</strong>, streamlining the entire process.  </p>\n<h2>Team Info</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Arian Allenson Valdez - lead developer/ideation</li>\n<li>Mikayla Pace - game developer/ideation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>AgentSFX compromises of a godot plugin and a web app:</p>\n<p>As a Godot plugin, it automatically generates <strong>voiceovers and sound effects</strong> with AI. With a single click, it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyzes your node structure and a screenshot of your game</li>\n<li>Thinks of the possible sound bank for your game</li>\n<li>Creates a Sound Bank for your game that you can integrate</li>\n<li>Generates <strong>lifelike NPC dialogue</strong> using <strong>Eleven Labs</strong><br/></li>\n<li>Create <strong>background music</strong> with <strong>FAL</strong><br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This removes the need for external tools and/or manually scouring the internet/sound databases for audio, making sound design effortless.  </p>\n<p>As a web app, it only provides analysis for your screenshot, but we envision a full end to end workflow for audio design (i.e. revisions, finalizations, creating tickets, asking for feedback)</p>\n<p>We use Next.JS/Vercel for the web app</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The godot plugin itself consists of 3 'core' nodes, that the user can even use without the agent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI_SFX - generates sound effect via prompts using Eleven Labs</li>\n<li>AI_Dialog - generates high quality voice acting using Eleven Labs</li>\n<li>AI_BGM - generates BGM using FAL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then have the 4th node AIAnalyzer, which serves as the AI Agent orchestrating the entire show. AI Analyzer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>analyzes the node structure and screenshot (via FAL vision models)</li>\n<li>processes the analysis (via FAL LLM)</li>\n<li>proceeds to create the core nodes to a SoundsEffect node that the user can use</li>\n<li>the user can then integrate the node to the game engine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Possible improvements are syncing/persisting audio keys, allowing users to make the AI 'reanalyze' things it has not yet seen/considered.</p>\n<p>For the web app, we use next.js + the same integrations.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The entire thing actually was pretty smooth development wise - the hardest part of the hackathon was finding the right idea. We even thought of just skipping this one, but after seeing a random action heavy video clip (that only had sound effects), we thought - can we make an AI agent that analyzes a 'silent' game and generate the audio for it?</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Making essentially two tools (web app and godot plugin) in pretty much only 1 working day was something we are very proud of.</p>\n<p>The really seamless integration with Godot is something we're proud of as well! There are lots of improvements to be made still but it's already plenty useful!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How to optimize <strong>AI workflows</strong> for real-time generation.<br/></li>\n<li>The power of <strong>automation</strong> in game development.<br/></li>\n<li>The challenges of <strong>AI-driven creative tools</strong> and how to refine them. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Compliance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We acknowledge adherence to hackathon rules and deadlines - heh we even started so late! :P </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Agent SFX</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customization options</strong> for voice styles and sound types.  In particular, allowing users to train their own voice through the web app, or through a sound bank in the engine.</li>\n<li>More tight integration with the game engine</li>\n<li>Expanding to <strong>other game engines</strong> beyond Godot</li>\n<li>Providing an end to end workflow using the web app. (brainstorming, task management, feedback, finalization) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 Agent SFX is just the beginning\u2014our goal is to revolutionize AI-powered game audio!  </p>\n</div>",
